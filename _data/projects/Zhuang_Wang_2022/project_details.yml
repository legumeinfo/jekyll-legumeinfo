  description: '<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0822258">The NSF-funded SoyMap II project</a>,
    led by Scott Jackson, involved sequencing corresponding regions around six regions of interest
    from eight <i>Glycine</i> species, to gain insights into the polyploid and perennial genome evolution and
    genetic potential for soybean improvement. This project finished in 2012. See more information about the project,
    including pictures of the focal species and descriptions of the target regions, at
    <a href="https://legacy.soybase.org/soymap2/">legacy.soybase.org/soymap2</a>.<br><br>
    A subsequent project, led by Jianxin Ma and Dajian Zhang, with funding primarily from
    the Shandong Province (China), completed the genome assemblies for the species used in
    the SoyMap II project. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35288665/">Zhuang, Wang et al. (2022)</a> paper
    below describes the genome assemblies and analyses from the second project.

      abstract: Polyploidy and life-strategy transitions between annuality and
        perenniality often occur in flowering plants. However, the evolutionary
        propensities of polyploids and the genetic bases of such transitions
        remain elusive. We assembled chromosome-level genomes of representative
        perennial species across the genus Glycine including five diploids and a
        young allopolyploid, and constructed a Glycine super-pangenome framework
        by integrating 26 annual soybean genomes. These perennial diploids
        exhibit greater genome stability and possess fewer centromere repeats
        than the annuals. Biased subgenomic fractionation occurred in the
        allopolyploid, primarily by accumulation of small deletions in gene
        clusters through illegitimate recombination, which was associated with
        pre-existing local subgenomic differentiation. Two genes annotated to
        modulate vegetative-reproductive phase transition and lateral shoot
        outgrowth were postulated as candidates underlying the
        perenniality-annuality transition. Our study provides insights into
        polyploid genome evolution and lays a foundation for unleashing genetic
        potential from the perennial gene pool for soybean improvement.
