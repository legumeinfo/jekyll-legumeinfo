      abstract: "Domestication of soybeans occurred under the intense human-directed selections aimed at developing high-yielding lines. Tracing the domestication history and identifying the genes underlying soybean domestication require further exploration. Here, we developed a high-throughput NJAU 355 K SoySNP array and used this array to study the genetic variation patterns in 367 soybean accessions, including 105 wild soybeans and 262 cultivated soybeans. The population genetic analysis suggests that cultivated soybeans have tended to originate from northern and central China, from where they spread to other regions, accompanied with a gradual increase in seed weight. Genome-wide scanning for evidence of artificial selection revealed signs of selective sweeps involving genes controlling domestication-related agronomic traits including seed weight. To further identify genomic regions related to seed weight, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted across multiple environments in wild and cultivated soybeans. As a result, a strong linkage disequilibrium region on chromosome 20 was found to be significantly correlated with seed weight in cultivated soybeans. Collectively, these findings should provide an important basis for genomic-enabled breeding and advance the study of functional genomics in soybean."

      abstract: "Crop-related wild species contain new sources of genetic diversity for crop improvement. Wild soybean (Glycine soja Sieb. and Zucc.) is the progenitor of cultivated soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and can be used as an essential genetic resource for yield improvements. In this research, using genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 96 out of 113 wild soybean accessions with 114,090 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (with minor allele frequencies ≤ 0.05), SNPs associated with five yield-related traits were identified across multiple environments. In total, 41 SNPs were significantly associated with the traits in two or more environments (significance threshold P ≤ 8.76 × 10–6), with 29, 7, 3, and 2 SNPs detected for 100-seed weight (SW), maturity time (MT), seed yield per plant (SY) and flowering time (FT), respectively. BLAST search against the Glycine soja W05 reference genome was performed, 20 candidate genes were identified based on these 41 significant SNPs. One candidate gene, GsCID1 (Glysoja.04g010563), harbored two significant SNPs—AX-93713187, with a non-synonymous mutation, and AX-93713188, with a synonymous mutation. GsCID1 was highly expressed during seed development based on public information resources. The polymorphisms in this gene were associated with SW. We developed a derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) marker for GsCID1 that was highly associated with SW and was validated as a functional marker. In summary, the revealed SNPs/genes are useful for understanding the genetic architecture of yield-related traits in wild soybean, which could be used as a potential exotic resource to improve cultivated soybean yields."
