  document: "Soybean Genetics Committee Report 2003 Minutes<br>The Soybean Genetics Committee met from 7:00 to
    8:00 p.m., February 17, 2003, at the Sheraton West Port Hotel, St. Louis, MO, in conjunction
    with the Soybean Breeders' Workshop.<br>Brian Diers called the meeting to order.<br>Committee
    members in attendance were D. Grant, B. Diers, J. Orf, V. Poysa, P. Chen, R. Fioritto, D.
    Lohnes, and R. Nelson. The terms of D. Grant and J. Tamulonis expired this year. J. Tamulonis
    was reelected to the committee and D. Grant moved to a ex officio position on the committee. D.
    Grant's elected position on the committee was filled by P. Arelli. Nominated by B.Diers,
    P.Arelli was unanimously elected as the incoming chair of the committee.<br>The following were

    officio) rpalmer@iastate.edu<br>D. Grant (ex officio) dgrant@iastate.edu<br>A major function of
    the Soybean Genetics Committee is to review manuscripts describing new genes for proper use of
    nomenclature and to review supporting data. In addition, the committee<br>reviews manuscripts
    that describe additions or changes to classical linkage groups. During the year, the committee
    made decisions on the genetic interpretations for seven manuscripts and there is one final
    manuscript that is still under review. The following manuscripts were reviewed:<br>K.D.
    Burnham, A.E. Dorrance, D.M. Francis, R.J. Fioritto, and S.K. St. Martin. Rps8, A new locus in
    soybean for resistance to Phytophthora sojae.<br>Decision by the committee: Approved gene
    designation Rps8.<br>A.A. Mahama and R.G. Palmer. Genetic linkage in soybean: classical genetic
    linkage groups 6 and 8, and translocation breakpoints.<br>Decision by the committee: Merge
    classical linkage groups (CLG) 6 and 8 and drop 6.<br>K.K. Kato and R.G. Palmer. Genetic
    identification of a female partial-sterile in soybean.<br>Decision by the committee: Approve
    gene designations Fsp-a and Fsp-b.<br>K.K. Kato and R.G. Palmer. Duplicate
    chlorophyll-deficient y18 loci in soybean.<br>Decision by the committee: Approve gene
    designation Y18 (Urbana) and Y24 (Ames 1).<br>J. Abe, O.K. Han, K. Komatsu, and Y. Shimamoto.
    Assignment of the E4 locus into soybean classical linkage group 4.<br>Decision by the
    committee: Approve the assignment of E4 to near Enp and Ln on classical linkage group
    4.<br>T.E. Devine. Genetic linkage of the soybean genes Pd2 and Lf2.<br>Decision by the
    committee: Assign this linkage to classical linkage group 16.<br>G. Ma, P. Chen, G.R. Buss, and
    S.A. Tolin. Genetic study of a lethal necrosis to soybean mosaic virus in PI 5073389
    soybean.<br>Decision by the committee: Approve the gene designation Rsv1-n.<br>K.K. Kato, and
    R.G. Palmer. Molecular mapping of four lethal ovule mutants in soybean.<br>Decision by the
    committee: Approve the gene designations Fsp2, Fsp3, Fsp4, and Fsp5.<br>The main topic
    discussed at the committee meeting was nomenclature for genetic loci. D. Grant prepared a
    proposal for naming genetic loci, which was distributed to the committee prior to the meeting.
    After a few suggested modifications were discussed, a motion was made and approved that the
    committee recommends the use of the nomenclature guidelines proposed by Grant. These guidelines
    will be formalized by D. Grant and reviewed again by the committee and the wider soybean
    genetics research community before final approval. These new guidelines will be used for naming
    new genetic loci and already named loci will not be renamed. These nomenclature guidelines will
    apply only to genetic loci that do not have an identified phenotype. Loci with an identifiable
    phenotype will be named using current rules. In addition, the current naming system for simple
    sequence repeat markers will continue to be used.<br>Send all manuscripts that need to by
    reviewed by the Soybean Genetics Committee to:<br>Dr. Prakash Arelli<br>USDA-ARS<br>605 Airways
