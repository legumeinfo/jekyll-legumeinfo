  abstract: "  The complex genomes of crops like soybean are rich in highly repeated sequences (55%) that block
    chromosome walking from linked DNA markers to target genes (Danesh et al., 1998) and confound
    shotgun approaches to complete genome sequencing (Boysen et al., 1999). In addition, much of
    the rest of the soybean genome is moderately repeated (25%) or unique but duplicated in two
    homeologous loci (20%)(Grant et al., 2000). Success of map-based cloning in crop plants depends
    on the target<br>gene being localized to such a short genetic interval (0.01-0.1 cM) that the
    markers and target gene are separated from regions rich in repeated sequences (Meksem et al.,
    2000; 2001). Fine mapping to this degree can be accomplished 10-50 fold more efficiently with a
    physical map that encompasses the whole genome than by marker saturation and chromosome walking
    or landing (Zhang and Wing, 1997; Meksem et al., 2001a)."

- title: "Users Guide to the Soybean Physical Map at the Website http://hbz.tamu.edu/."
  authors: "Jeffry Shultz 1, David A. Lightfoot 1"
  abstract: "  To develop the physical map of soybean, we have developed three large-insert soybean DNA
    libraries from 'Forrest' (Meksem et al., 2000). Texas A&M has generated restriction enzyme
    fragment fingerprints for 90,000 of 112,600 clones. About 50,000 clone fingerprints have been
    posted at at Physical Mapping sections of http://hbz.tamu.edu/. Each clone was tested for the
    content of known genetic markers and some ESTs (Wu et al., 2001) and SNPs (Zobrist et al.,
    2000; Meksem et al., 2001; Shultz et al., 2001). We have shown that fingerprints of BACs from
    other cultivars can be integrated with this data set (Shultz et al., 2001). The integrated
    genetic and physical map will inexpensively and rapidly enable identification of a number of
    genes underlying QTL of economic importance. Here we report methods of use for the genetic and
    physical map. This guide should allow soybean researchers to use the website at which data can
    be retrieved, clones submitted for fingerprinting and clones requested."

- title: "Selection Limits - How Close Are We?"
  authors: "S.K. St. Martin"
  abstract: "  Theoretical and empirical studies of selection limits have provided a way to use estimates of
    genetic gain and effective population size to calculate the plateau (selection limit) beyond
    which further gains are impossible. Literature pertinent to genetic gain for soybean yield in
    North America was surveyed for this purpose. Most results indicate that the highest-yielding
    existing cultivars are far from the calculated selection limit. Selection limits are not an
    imminent threat to North American soybean breeders, but this does not imply that efforts to
    broaden the germplasm base are wasted."
