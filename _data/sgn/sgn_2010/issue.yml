    to study stability performance over eight environments for seed yield and its components in 40
    genetically diverse genotypes (37 indigenous + 3 exotic) of soybean using a randomized complete
    block design. The partitioning of (environment + genotype x environment) mean squares showed
    that environments (linear) differed significantly and were quite diverse with regards to their
    effects on the performance of genotypes for seed yield and majority of yield components. Stable
    genotypes were identified for wider environments and specific environments with high per se
    performance (over general mean) for seed yield per plant. The investigation revealed that the
    genotype MACS-47 was desirable and stable across the environments. Other genotypes PK-308,
    Bisra Soya, Indra Soya-9, Alankar, and IS-22 were found to be suitable for favorable
    situations, while genotypes Pusa-16, Pusa-40, MACS-2, MACS-450, and JS-325 were responsible to
    poor environments for seed yield.<br>Key words: G X E interaction, stability analysis, seed

- title: "Gene Effects for Major Quantitative Traits In Soybean [Glycine Max (L.) Merrill]"

  abstract: "  Department of Genetic and Plant Breeding, College of Agriculture, G. B. Pant University of
    Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar 263145 , U.S. Nagar, Uttarakhand,
    India.<br>Abstract<br>Breeding methods are dictated by the gene action, interaction, and
    linkage relationship of genes conditioning continuous phenotypic variation of various metric
    traits. Thus both additive and non-additive components of genetic variance, along their allied
    parameters are of immense use for plant breeders under different situations. An estimate of
    additive variance and non-additive variance provides a measure of how likely particular traits
    can be selected for or against and that of whether hybridization or a population improvement
    programme. The present investigation was carried out at Crop Research Center, Pantnagar during
    the Kharif season of 2008-2009. Five generations viz. P1, P2, F1, F2, and F3 were evaluated in
    an experiment under a compact family block design to estimate gene effects for major agronomic
    traits in three soybean single crosses (PS 1347 x G. soja, JS 335 x UPSM 534 and PS 1347 x JS
    335). The results showed additive gene effects determined the inheritance of agronomic
    characters viz. days to 50 per cent flowering, days to maturity, plant height, and harvest
    index. Dominance gene action was critical in determining the yield. Duplicate epistasis was
    significantly important in inheritance of most traits studied. On the basis of results obtained
    from the present investigation, it is suggested that these major quantitative traits in the
    desirable genotypes play a major role in the improvement of high yielding varieties of soybean
    through exploitation of additive and non-additive variances.<br>Key words: Soybean,
