    Yates and Bill Schapaugh. Guests present: George Graef (Univ. of Nebraska), Istavan Rajcan
    (Univ. of Guelph, Canada) and Tri Vuong (Univ. of Missouri - Columbia).<br>David Walker called
    the meeting to order at 7:05 p.m.<br>The Soybean Genetics Committee (SGC) voted to elect Harish
    Gandhi (Syngenta Seeds, Slater, IA), George Graef (University of Nebraska), Istvan Rajcan
    (University of Guelph) and Kristin Bilyeu (USDA-ARS, Columbia, MO) to serve three year terms
    (2010 - 2013) on the Soybean Genetics Committee. Members completing their three year terms
    include: David Walker, David Sleper and Bill Schapaugh.<br>The committee elected David Hyten to
    serve as committee chair for 2010 - 11. <br>The committee voted to excuse Gary Stacey from SGC
    membership as per his request, but noted that he was willing to serve as a consultant on cases
    in which his molecular genetics expertise would be of value.<br>David Grant proposed that the
    committee approve the use of temporary gene names, but recommended changes to the exiting
    nomenclature rules. The advantages and disadvantages of using temporary names and the merits of
    alternative naming formats were discussed. The committee voted to approve the use of temporary
    gene names. The committee voted to designate temporary gene names by placing the gene name in
    brackets, followed by an underscore and then the number of the plant introduction or genotype
    in which the gene was identified. <br>An example of the new nomenclature format would be:
    [Rpp3]_PI506764 instead of Rpp?(Hyuuga). This indicates that the gene (or QTL) mapped to the
    same region as the Rpp3 gene, but that at present there is not sufficient data to determine
    whether it is allelic to Rpp3, or located at a tightly linked locus, possibly in the same gene
    family. Although PI numbers are more difficult for many people to remember than some cultivar
    or local names for accessions, the SGC encourages their use to avoid confusing two accessions
    with the same local name or two sublines of the same accession.<br>The committee discussed the
    request of Joe Polacco to rename several urease genes and provided recommendations to modify
    the proposed names. These include elimination of italic type in the name, and addition of a
    prefix consisting of a five-letter abbreviation of the genus and species of the source
    organism. In the case of soybean, for example, this would be 'Glyma'. In addition, the SGC
    recommends the use of upper case letters to indicate that an allele is dominant over another
    allele whose name begins with a lower case letter, rather than using upper and lower case
    letters to indicate taxonomic origins of genes, as proposed in the manuscript. After evaluating
    these suggestions the authors will be requested to resubmit the manuscript to the committee for
    consideration.<br>David Walker informed the committee that Henry Nguyen will step down as
    editor of the Soybean Genetics Newsletter on 1 March 2010. The committee suggested that David
    seek input from participants attending the Soybean Breeder's Workshop on the usefulness of
    continuing the newsletter. (This was done, and though no formal vote was taken, comments from
    the audience seemed to suggest that the Soybean Genetics Newsletter may no longer be essential
    to the soybean breeding/genetics community, particularly since so few reports had been
    submitted to it in recent years.) <br>With no further business, a motion to adjourn the meeting
    was approved at 8:02 p.m."
