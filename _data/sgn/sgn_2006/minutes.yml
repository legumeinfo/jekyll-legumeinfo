    University indicated that an article published in Crop Science (1996) 36:1153-1156 stated the
    Soybean Genetics Committee had tentatively approved a gene symbol rj8 for nodulation response.
    Prakash Arelli reviewed previous Soybean Genetics Committee minutes and indicated no such
    approval by the committee. The committee decided to review the article immediately and to
    approve the symbol based on the data presented in the article. <br>The Gene symbol Rag1was
    approved for aphid resistance from the Dowling soybean. The aphid resistant gene from Jackson
    soybean was given the symbol Rag until it can be determined to be the same or a different
    allele than from Dowling. The committee also approved male sterility alleles at the same locus
    Ms2ms2 (Ames 1) and Ms2ms2 (Ames 2).<br>It was noted that people who name and publish new gene
    symbols or QTL be encouraged to submit manuscripts to the Soybean Genetics Committee for
    approval to insure symbols and QTL are properly named and correctly added to soybase.<br>David
    Grant reported that gene symbols and QTL are current on soybase with new information being
    added as it becomes available.<br>There being no other business the meeting was adjourned."
