- title: "Database and information retrieval system for soybean varieties"
  authors: "Savita Kolhe*, Kavita Mundankar, C.Tara Satyavathi, P.G. Karmakar and S.P. Tiwari"
  abstract: "  A software package (VIS) on varietal Information for Soybean has been developed in MSACCESS 97.
    This package provides detailed information on 35 different morphological characters of all the
    released/notified varieties of soybean in India. The information is retrieved in the form of
    comparison tables, colorful pictures and reports in a quick, easy and efficient manner with
    minimal keyboard intervention as per different users' needs."

- title: "Soybean Transformation via the Pollen Tube Pathway"
  authors: "Zenglu Li1,2, Randall L. Nelson1,3, Jack M. Widholm1, and Andrew Bent1,4"
  abstract: "  The pollen tube pathway method of transformation has been reported to be successful in several
    crops including soybean. DNA can be transferred by cutting the stigma following<br>pollination
    and applying the DNA solution on the severed style. DNA presumably reaches the ovary by flowing
    down the pollen tube and then integrates into the just fertilized but undivided zygotic cells.
    To provide the molecular evidence for this procedure, the plasmids pBI221 carrying a CaMV35S
    promoter-beta glucuronidase (gus) gene-nos terminator gene fusion construct and pBI0122
    carrying a CaMV35S promoter-bar-g73' terminator gene fusion construct were used. Approximately
    5000 seeds were produced from the flowers treated with DNA. None of the seeds from the plants
    treated with DNA containing the bar gene were found to be as resistant as the positive control.
    Morphological variation was observed in some plants, but this was not observed in the following
    generation. Approximately 2% of the seeds from plants treated with DNA containing the gus gene
    had a positive reaction in the GUS assay, however, no GUS activity was observed in the plant
    leaves from those seeds. Less than 3% of progeny seeds tested expressed a positive reaction and
    polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with seedling DNA did not detect the gus gene. Thus, we were
    unable to confirm the positive results of others when we used screenable marker genes."
