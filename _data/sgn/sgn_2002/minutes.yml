  document: "The Soybean Genetics Committee met from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m., February 18, 2002, at the Sheraton West
    Port Hotel, St. Louis, MO, in conjunction with the Soybean Breeders Workshop. Elroy Cober
    called the meeting to order<br>Committee members in attendance were G. Buss, E. Cober, B.
    Diers, J. Orf, R. Fioritto, D. Grant, D. Lohnes, and R. Nelson. Also in attendance were Vaino
    Poysa, Pengyin Chen, and Prakash Arelli. The terms of Elroy Cober and Glenn Buss are expiring
    this year. New members elected to fill the expired terms were Vaino Poysa and Pengyin Chen.
    Current committee members and the February expiration date of their terms include:<br>D.Grant
    (2003) dgrant@iastate.edu <br>J. Tamulonis (2003) john.p.tamulonis@monsanto.com <br>B.Diers
    (2004) bdiers@uiuc.edu <br>J.H. Orf (2004) orfxx001@maroon.tc.umn.edu <br>V. Poysa (2005)
    poysav@em.arg.ca <br>P. Chen (2005) pchen@uark.edu <br>R.J. Fioritto (ex officio)
    fioritto.1@osu.edu <br>D.G. Lohnes (ex officio) lohnes.2@osu.edu <br>R.L. Nelson (ex officio)
    rnelson@uiuc.edu <br>A discussion of gene nomenclature, especially as applied to molecular
    markers, was led by David Grant. The current system is apparently unworkable in Soybase because
    it is based on the restriction enzyme used or allele information rather than a specific genetic
    locus. David Grant will develop a proposal for naming molecular marker loci and circulate it
    within the community. <br>One of the major functions of the Soybean Genetics Committee is to
    review manuscripts describing new genes for proper use of nomenclature and to review supporting
    data. Only one manuscript was reviewed this year - the gene symbol Rsv4 was assigned to the
    gene in PI 88788 for resistance to SMV (Gunduz et al.).<br>The Soybean Genetics Newsletter will
    not be editing articles for style, nor will they have links added. Authors will be encouraged
    to markup their articles and instructions will be provided for this purpose. <br>A motion
    (Diers/Orf) was carried which reinstates the requirement to ask for authors permission
    before citing articles in the Soybean Genetics Newsletter. Beginning in 1997 the policy had
    been changed to: <br>Data presented in the Soybean Genetics Newsletter may be used in
    publications without the consent of the respective authors unless a statement precluding use of
    the data accompanies the article.<br>We will revert to the pre-1997 statement:<br>Data
    presented in the Soybean Genetics Newsletter are not to be used in publications without the
    consent of the respective authors.<br>Brian Diers was elected chairman of the committee for the
    coming year. Manuscripts for committee review should be sent to him."
