- title: "A Preliminary Genetic Linkage Map of Soybean Using an Intraspecific Cross of Two Cultivars: 'Peking' and 'Lee'"
  authors: "W. Yang1, D. B. Weaver1, B. L. Nielsen2 and J. Qiu3"
  abstract: "  A total of 64 EcoR I (+3) and Mse I (+3) primer combinations were used to generate amplified
    fragment length polymorphisms in a soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) mapping population that
    consisted of 116 F2 plants from a cross between two cultivars: 'Peking' and 'Lee'. One hundred
    eleven amplified fragment length polymorphism markers were developed from 30 primer pairs. A
    molecular map consisting of 74 amplified fragment length polymorphisms, 2 simple sequence
    repeats, and one phenotypic trait (RcsPeking, resistance to Cercospora sojina), has been
    constructed. The map defined 599.8 cM of the soybean genome comprising 15 linkage groups. The
    average interval between these markers was 11.9 cM. An additional 37 polymorphic markers
    remained unlinked."

  authors: "Yu Bin Li, Zhiang Hu (Author for Correspondence), Qin Zhang, Xin Deng, and Hong Xin Wang"
  abstract: "  Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) consist of tandemly repeated core sequences
    that often vary in repeat number and are flanked by conserved DNA sequences. (Maughan et al
    1995). It is well-known that SSRs are ideal genetic markers in that they are (1) highly
    abundant and evenly distributed (2) highly polymorphic (3) codominant (4) rapidly typed via PCR
    and (5) very accessible to other laboratories via published primer sequences (Weber 1990;
    Saghai-Maroof et al 1994). The length polymorphisms of SSRs in soybean and wild soybean
    (Glycine soja) have been widely studied (Akkaya et al 1992; Jiang et al 1995; Akkaya et al
    1995; Maughan et al 1995 and Powell et al 1996). However to our knowledge SSRs DNA marker has
    not yet been served as a genetic marker in the natural populations of wild soybean (Glycine
    soja Sieb. & Zucc.). The salt tolerance efficiencies of wild soybean individuals were evaluated
    by using the method in our previous work (Hu and Wang 1997; Wang et al. 1997) and several RAPD
    markers were found to be linked to the salt tolerance character of wild soybean (Zhang et al.
    1999). In present paper we evaluated the applicability of SSRs as a source of genetic markers
    in salt resistance of wild soybean in two natural populations in saline conditions."

- title: "Further Study on Genotypic Variation of Salt Tolerance to Wild Soybean (Glycine soja Sieb. & Zucc.)"
  authors: "Yu Bin Li, Zhi Ang Hu (Author for Correspondence) and Hong Xin Wang"
  abstract: "  Soil salinity has a major impact on plant growth and affects about 6% of the total global land
    area (Flowers and Yeo 1995). The development of salt tolerant crops including soybean could
    greatly help to meet demands on the food supply. The wild perennial Glycine species have been
    suggested as a potential source of germplasm to improve soybean for agronomic traits including
    salt tolerance (Brown et al 1984;Pantalone & Kenworthy 1989). It is well known that the annual
    wild soybean Glycine soja Sieb. & Zucc. is the unique close relative of cultivated soybean and
    has been effectively used in soybean breeding. Hu and Wang (1997) first reported the variation
    of salt tolerance of each plant in natural populations of Glycine soja by using a new method
    for evaluating salt tolerance efficiencies (STEs) of individual plants based on the timing of
    the leaf injury. In their experiments however continuous illumination and a constant
    temperature(21oC) were maintained and only the seedlings were tested. The present work further
    evaluates the salt tolerance of wild soybean in two saline populations under different
    temperature schedules and developmental stages in order to elucidate salt tolerance of Glycine
    Soja in the real and natural situation."

- title: "Changes of Proline Levels and Abscisic Acid Content in Tolerant/Sensitive Cultivars of Soybean under Osmotic Conditions"
  authors: "Zheng Yi-Zhi and Li Tian"
  abstract: "  In responses to drought and salinity stresses many plant species including soybean accumulated
    high levels of proline (Pro) which is thought to function in stress adaptation [1]. Also
    abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the responses of plants to drought stress. It
    appears that drought stress triggers the production of endogenous ABA which in turn induced the
    transcription of several genes. These genes are also thought to function in the protection of
    cells from dehydration [2]. Here changes of free proline levels and endogenous ABA content in
    seedling leaves of different soybean cultivars were detected showing a correlation of biotypes
    having elevated levels of proline and ABA content with enhanced tolerance to PEG stress."

  authors: "Zhang Qin, Yun Rui, Hu Zhiang, Zhong Min, Deng Xin"
  abstract: "  Much progress has been made towards elucidating the underlying mechanisms controlling salt
    tolerance in plant (M. R. Foolad et al., 1997; H. Pakniyat et al., 1997). These studies led to
    the analysis and isolation of genes that encode proteins related to salt tolerance. In previous
    study, we applied DAF (DNA Amplification Fingerprinting) to screen two salt-tolerant soybean
    cultivars (Morgan and Wenfeng No.7) and two salt-sensitive ones (Hark and Jackson) and found
    three polymorphic markers (8.6f/350bp, 8-27/240bp and 8-15/215bp) which only appeared in
    salt-tolerant cultivars (Zhong et al., 1997). In the present work, we describe the cloning and
    characterization of the specific marker 8-27/240bp in order to further study whether it plays
    an important role in salt tolerance of soybean."

- title: "Variations for Biomass, Economic Yield and Harvest Index among Soybean Cultivars of Maturity Groups III and IV in Argentina"
  authors: "M.E. Weilenmann de Tau (etau@balcarce.inta.gov.ar) and J. L&uuml;quez"
  abstract: "  In the southern pampeana region of Argentine, south of the parallel 36&deg; Latitude S, soybean
    (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) crop is grown on approximately 200.000 hectares with further expansion
    expected. Cultivars of maturity Groups III and IV are well adapted to this zone. Identify plant
    traits that contribute to crop productivity is essential for developing high yielding cultivars
    (Salman and Brinkman, 1992). Harvest index (HI), defined as ratio between economic yield (EY)
    and the total biomass i.e biological yield (BY), influences EY more than any other yield
    determining plant trait (Bhardwaj and Bhagsari, 1989). Donald and Hamblin (1976) have reviewed
    the history of the concept of HI and concluded that it may be used as a criterion for yield
    evaluations. Soybean economic yield was reported to be correlated with HI (Bhardwaj and
    Bhagsari, 1989). Cultivars with high HI should be combined with cultivars having high biomass
    to increase yield (McVetty and Evans, 1980). The values of HI in soybean (Glycine max (L.)
    Merrill) range between 0.47 and 0.56, with absence of water stress (Hume et al.,1989).
    Twenty-one soybean genotypes of maturity group IV and six of maturity group III were evaluated
    under two different conditions of humidity with the following objectives: a) determine
    variability for EY, BY and HI among soybean cultivars, b) identify genotypes having high BY, EY
    and HI and c) determine the associations between BY and HI with EY in order to enhance soybean
    grain yields combining superior genotypes for BY and HI."

- title: "Inheritance of Genes Controlling Photoperiod Insensitivity and Flowering Time in Soybean"
  authors: "I. M. Tasma1, L. L. Lorenzen2, D. E. Green1, and R. C. Shoemaker1,3"
  abstract: "  The objective of this research was to study the inheritance of genes controlling photoperiod
    insensitivity and flowering time in soybean. Two single-cross populations, IX132 (PI 317.336 X
    'Corsoy'), and IX136 (PI 317.334B X 'Corsoy') were developed for this purpose. The populations
    were inbred to obtain 101 and 100 F6:7 lines, respectively, using a modified single seed
    descent. Flowering time (days to R1) of the RI lines from each population was observed in the
    growth chamber at 12 h and 20 h photoperiods using fluorescent and incandescent lamps. Results
    show that the RI lines have dramatically different responses to day length. A normal
    distribution of flowering times was observed when the lines were grown in growth chamber with
    12 h photoperiod. When the lines were grown in growth chamber with 20 h photoperiod, however, a
    discontinuous distribution was observed. This suggested that the insensitivity of the RI lines
    on long day length may be controlled by few major genes. The time of flowering was delayed in
    almost all lines when grown in growth chamber with 20 h photoperiod compared to those grown in
    the growth chamber with 12 h photoperiod. The flowering delays were 5 to 75 days in population
    IX132 and 0 to 75 days in population IX136. Chi-square tests show that the segregation data fit
    a 1:6:1 ratio in population IX132 and IX136. Based on these tests a minimum of three genes are
    proposed to control photoperiod insensitivity in both populations."

  authors: "Kimbely Zobrist 1, Khalid Meksem 1, Chengcang Wu 2, Quanzhou Tao2, Hongbin Zhang 2, David A. Lightfoot 1 "
  abstract: "  Investment in crop genomic science is justified by the existence of genus, species and cultivar
    specific genes with no known function. A subgroup, within this group of genes, is expected to
    be genes of agronomic and economic importance such as disease resistance genes, major yield
    determinates and genes that produce specific chemicals and components. Identification of
    members of the economically important gene subgroup has been painstakingly slow by conventional
    genetics and preliminary genomics.<br>A microsattelite marker map, with about 600 mapped
    markers, is available in soybean. This anchored genetic map has been integrated with RFLP,
    RAPD, and AFLP marker maps (Shoemaker and Specht 1995; Mansur et al. 1996; Keim et al., 1996;
    Chang et al., 1997 Cregan et al., 1999). About 300 QTL conditioning traits of agronomic
    importance have been identified by about 15 groups over the last 10 years (Imsande et al.,
    1998; Soybase http://probe.nalusda.gov:8300). However, it is not feasible to fine-map and

  authors: "J.P. Tomkins, D.A. Frisch, J.R. Byrum and R.A.. Wing"
  abstract: "  The construction of a physical framework for the soybean genome requires the use of large insert
    genomic libraries. The bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning system appears to offer
    advantages over other large insert cloning systems as discussed previously (Shizuya et al.,
    1992; Woo et al., 1994). Therefore, the BAC system is very appealing as a vehicle for advanced
    genome analysis in soybean. At the present time, the construction of three soybean BAC
    libraries has been reported in the literature (Marek and Shoemaker, 1997; Danesh et al., 1998;
    Tomkins et al., 1999). Estimated coverage for these libraries range between 3 and 9 haploid
    genome equivalents. In order to develop a comprehensive physical framework for soybean using
    fingerprinting (Marra et al, 1997) and BAC end sequencing technologies, a deeper coverage BAC
    library providing at least 10 genome equivalents will be required. Our objective was to develop
    a deep coverage soybean BAC library for the purpose of creating a comprehensive physical
    framework of the soybean genome."

  authors: "Qi Yang & Jinling Wang"
  abstract: "  Two semicultivated (G.gracilis) and four cultivated (G.max) cultivars were used to make 15
    crosses and the resulting F1 and F2 progenies were evaluated for morphological yield and
    quality characters. The relationship among agronomic characters between intraspecific and
    interspecific soybean crosses was analyzed. The objective of this study was to compare the
    difference among agronomic characters between intraspecific and interspecific soybean crosses.
    Plants derived from crosses involving G.gracilis were taller more vigorous had greater seed and
    pod number /plant lower seed-stem ratio and smaller 100-seed weight than those from
    intraspecific crosses. In interspecific crosses taller and more vigorous plants had close
    association with lower seed-stem ratio. The correlations of 100-seeds weight with the duration
    of developing stage were in the opposite direction to those with seed and pod number/plant. The
    correlation of protein content with developing stage were in the opposite direction to that of
    oil content. It is suggested that it was difficulty to select plants both higher in protein and
    in oil content derived from interspecific crosses."

  authors: "V.N. Njiti, J.E. Johnson, G.A. Torto and D.A. Lightfoot."
  abstract: "  Effective selection of field resistance to soybean (Glycine max (L.) merr.) sudden death syndrome
    (SDS) measured by leaf scorch requires multiple environments. Current greenhouse assays reduce
    GxE but fail to predict field resistance. Our objective was to develop a greenhouse assay with
    a low GxE that improved selection of field resistance to SDS among soybeans. Recombinant inbred
    lines were evaluated for scorch severity (DS) at three inoculum rates in two experiments and
    for root infection at one inoculum rate in one experiment. Cultivars were compared using DS
    from one experiment at one inoculum rate. The heritability of DS among recombinant inbred lines
    in the greenhouse was 63% at the low 35% at the moderate and 34% at the high inoculum rates.
    Reduced inoculum rates in the greenhouse (<5000 spores cm3 of soil) provided DS values that
    significantly correlated with field leaf scorch. The number of lines potentially resistant to
    SDS within a segregating population could be reduced by 57% using a F. solani inoculum rates of
    3,500 - 5,000 spores per cm3 of soil and greenhouse DS <1.9 for selection. About 10% of field
    resistant lines were eliminated by error. Among unrelated soybean cultivars the low inoculum
    rate separated genotypes (P <0.05) and their greenhouse DS significantly correlated with field
    DS (r =0.9) and disease index (r =0.86). Therefore the method is an effective tool for
    inheritance studies and cultivar trials."

  authors: "Wang Ke-Jing wangkejing@ihw.com.cn, Li Fu-Shan, Zhou Tao and Xu Zhan-You"
  abstract: "  The inheritance of a five leaflet mutation of soybeans originally inherited from the wild was
    studied using cross analysis. Six crosses were made between Five Leaf Bean with the five
    leaflet trait and other 6 lines of normal leaves. F2 plants of 5 crosses produced major three
    five leaflet leaves and also some minor four six and seven multifoliolate leaves. There were
    two kinds of segregation ratios for major five leaflet (including other multifoliolate leaves)
    and trifoliolate characters in the F2 progeny plants. Five crosses showed a goodness of fit to
    a 3 : 1 ratio and one cross showed a satisfactory 63 : 1 ratio. The cross analysis indicated
    that besides the Lf1 gene controlling the five leaflet trait other two newly found genes could
    also control this trait. These three genes were independently genetic incompletely dominant and
    effect-duplicated. The results also suggested that the Five Leaf Bean a donor of five leaflet
    genes acquired by random selection to a cross progenies ((cultivar1 x wild soybean) x
    cultivar2) had heterogeneous genotypes at the three loci among individuals."
