  document: "The Soybean Genetics Committee met from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m., February 21, 20000, at the Sheraton West
    Port Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri, in conjunction with the Soybean Breeders Workshop. Prakash
    Arelli called the meeting to order.<br>Committee members attending the meeting were; P. R.
    Arelli, G. R. Buss, E. R. Cober, P. B. Cregan, B. W. Diers, R. J. Fioritto, D. G. Lohnes, R. L.
    Nelson and T. W. Pfeiffer. C. Sneller and G. A. Graef both are recently elected by mail ballot
    to serve a three-year term. But G. Graef has declined to serve on the committee and D. Grant
    was elected during the meeting to replace G. Graef. At the conclusion of the meeting G. Buss
    was elected to succeed P. Arelli for the year ending in February 2001.<br>Also, in attendance
    at the meeting were Rich Wilson, R. D. Bernard, J. G. Burgon and Istavan Rajcan. Current
    committee members and the February expiration date for their terms on the committee
    include:<br>G.R. Buss (2002) Chair gbuss@vt.edu <br>E.R. Cober (2002) Coberer@em.agr.ca
    <br>P.B. Cregan (2001) pcregan@nal.usda.gov <br>R.J. Fioritto (ex officio) fioritto.1@osu.edu
    <br>D. Grant (2003) dgrant@iastate.edu <br>D.G. Lohnes (ex officio) lohnes.2@osu.edu <br>R.L.
    Nelson (ex officio) rnelson@uiuc.edu <br>T.W. Pfeiffer (2001) tpfeiffe@ca.uky.edu <br>C.
    Sneller (2003) csneller@comp.uark.edu <br>Procedure: As in the past, manuscripts concerning
    genetics interpretation, gene symbols, and linkages should be sent to the chair of the Soybean
    Genetics Committee for review. To facilitate the review process, the committee will proceed as
    follows:<br>1. The review will only be for 'validity of the genetic interpretations' and
    'appropriateness of gene symbol.'<br>2. Reviewers of manuscripts will be given a deadline of
    forty-five days to return the reviewed manuscript to the chair. If the authors have not
    received a reply within sixty-days of submission, they should contact the
    chair.<br>Assignment/Approval of Gene Symbols: If gene symbols are being assigned where the
    material is from induced mutants, variants from heterogeneous populations, or from transgenic
    changes, then the authors should deposit representative sample of the genetic material in the
    Genetic Type Collection with Dr. R. L. Nelson, Curator.<br>Gene symbols will be approved only
    in cases where the relevant material is available in soybean germplasm collections for
    distribution to researchers. If the material is not made available, a symbol is not
    necessary.<br>Summaries for the past year: A list of soybean gene symbols approved during the
    year March 1999 through February 2000 include the following:<br>1. On January 1, 2000,
    committee concurred with the conclusion of Glenn Buss, et al. that resistance to soybean mosaic
    virus from cv.Raiden is controlled by a single dominant gene that is allelic to Rsv1.<br>2. On
    September 17, 1999, the committee agreed with the interpretations and conclusions as provided
    by Walter Fehr's group that they developed a new. mutant allele fan3 for reduced linolenate
    that is not at the fan1 or fan2 locus.<br>3. On May 6, 1999 based on the review of the soybean
    genetics committee it was agreed with the interpretation by Walter Fehr's group that A25 has an
    allele fap6 for evaluated palmitate which is at a locus other than fap1fap2, fap3 and
    fap4.<br>4. On July 6, 1999, the committee concluded that it was not required to review the
    assignment of Y18 in Ames 2 by Reid Palmer etal., when it was already assigned previously.
    (Required by the USDA).<br>Arelli thanks the fellow committee members for their methodical
    review process and timely return to him with their conclusions. There were no complaints by any
    of the authors except one author who was a bit impatient and somewhat sarcastic."
