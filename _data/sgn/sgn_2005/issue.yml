- title: "Evaluation of the vegetable soybean seedlings production by speedling styrofoam in comparison at the traditional system"
  authors: "Yokomizo, G.K. & Vello, N.A."
  abstract: "  Exist a soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) classification in two groups in agreement with yours
    principal uses: the first group, denominated grain type is employed manly in the bran and oil
    production, with medium grain size (one hundred seed weight (HSW) varying among 10 to 19 g),
    however have undesirable flavor; the second group is denominated food type, with flavor taste,
    constituted by two subgroups, the first with HSW smaller than 10 g, consumed in the sprouts
    form and natto (fermented) and the second with HSW presenting 20 g or more, being consumed
    directly by human principally in the immature pod form (R6 stage from scale of Fehr & Caviness
    (1977)) how snack, being denominated vegetable soybean, green soybean or edamame; presenting
    also the subgroups denominated sweet soybean (kuromame) and salad soybean (Vello, 1992).
    <br>Adequate balance between nutritional values and protein content is a important
    characteristic of the soybean, which is superior than the bovine meat, cow milk and eggs, this
    vegetal protein could heal the malnutrition from peoples in substitution to the animal protein
    (Carrao-Panizzi, 1988), with smaller production expenses (Canto & Turatti, 1989).<br>The main
    characteristics presented by the vegetable soybean are big seeds; sweetened flavor (similar to
    the nuts); carbohydrate content high; without or smaller undesirable smell (Rackis et al.,
    1979; Carrao-Panizzi, 1989; Orf, 1989; Vello, 1992) and smaller antinutritional factors
    content, principally the Bowmann Birk and Kunitz anti proteases (Orf, 1989), this characters
    are found in Japanese and Chinese genotypes.<br>Recently in Brazil appeared a crescent interest
    to produce food type soybean with great seeds for exportation to eastern countries and, also to
    United States and Australia. The seedling production in paper or plastic cups and styrofoam to
    posterior transplant in definite local is common practice to food type soybean, in this way the
    present research had as objective to evaluate the food type soybean seedling production in
    styrofoam in relation at the plastic cups. Aiming at to verify if exist differences between
    these systems. The comparison among evaluated materials is the second objective."

    United States and Australia.<br>A problem existent in the exotic genotypes is the non
    adaptability to the Brazilian conditions (Santos, 1988). A possible solution is the crossing
    among exotic genotypes with adapted type grain genotypes, aiming to meet in a same plant the
    genes to the direct human consumption characteristics, presents in the exotic genotypes, with
    the genes to tolerance at the photoperiod, high productivity and high seed physiologic quality
    from the adapted genotypes. The research objective was to compare the topcrosses performance
    among food type with grain type soybean by Scott-Knott classification in two environments."

- title: "Precocious germination of pollen grains in anthers of Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.)"
  authors: "Satwinder Kaur, Harsh Nayyar1, R.K. Bhanwra and Sanjeev Kumar"
  abstract: "  While examining the pollen fertility in different genotypes of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.),
    precocious pollen germination was noticed in all the ten anthers at bud, half-open flower and
    fully-open flower stages. Genotypic variation existed for this trait and out of the six
    genotypes evaluated, 'Palam soya' showed the least germination (17%) while 'Harit soya' had the
    highest germination (90%) at half-open stage. At fully-opened stage, all the pollen grains
    appeared to be germinated prior to their release from anthers. Stigma receptivity was
    relatively more in genotypes having higher precocious pollen germination indicating a positive
    correlation between the two. Some preliminary observations on this phenomenon, hitherto unknown
    in soybean, are reported here that may have significant implications in soybean breeding."

- title: "Screening and utilization of soybean germplasm for breeding resistance against Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus"
  authors: "S K Lal, V K S Rana, R L Sapra and K P Singh"
  abstract: "  Soybean are susceptible to about fifty different viruses. Under Indian conditions Mungbean yellow
    mosaic virus (MYMV), Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) and Groundnut bud necrosis virus (GBNV) are of
    prime importance. <br>The incidence of YMV was limited to north plain zone but since last few
    years it has been reported to spread to central zone as well. Central zone accounts for the 90%
    of the soybean production in the country. Singh et al. (1998) in order to determine the
    incidence of stem fly (Melanagromyza sojae), whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and yellow mosaic virus,
    fields of 20 villages were observed during kharif in 1996. they found that virus incidence
    occurred in patches in most of the area. <br>Yellow seeded soybean was introduced during
    nineteen sixties in India. At that time only three exotic varieties namely Bragg, Clark and
    Lee, found to be suitable under Indian conditions, were available to farmers. These varieties
    being highly susceptible to MYMV created general impression of a agricultural non-feasibility
    of yellow seeded soybean in India. Although this problem has been over come to some extent with
    the release of new varieties under All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on soybean.
    However, the resistance is not durable. Varieties showing field resistance at the time of
    release become susceptible to MYMV over a period of time. <br>The problem may be because of
    prevalence of different isolates of the causal virus. Biswas and Varma (2000) reported five
    naturally occurring variants of mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV), one from Vigna mungo (Bg3D
    from Delhi), two from Vigna radiata (MbD from Delhi and MbS from Sriganganagar), one from
    Phaseolus aconitifolia (MoL from Ludhiana) and one from Cajanus cajan (Pp1D from Delhi). Based
    on the host reactions a set of differentials was selected, which could be used for
    differentiating the five variants of MYMV. The variants of MYMV could be further distinguished
    by nucleic acid spot hybridization (NASH) using full length and fragment probes to MYMV-Bg3D
    DNA-A and DNA-B. The variants Pp1D and MbD reacted weakly with all the probes but these
    isolates could also be differentiated by using a smaller concentration of viral DNA. Based on
    the degree of hybridization the five variants appeared to fall into two distinct groups i.e.
    Pp1D in one group and Bg3D, MbS and MoL in the other. Usharani et al., (2004) studied various
    isolates from India on the basis of host range. Genomic components of the begomovirus causing
    yellow mosaic disease (YMD) in soybean in Delhi, India, were cloned, sequenced and evaluated
    for infectivity. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the virus isolate revealed more than 89%
    identity with mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV); therefore, it is designated as a
    soybean isolate of MYMIV (MYMIV-Sb). Total nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence
    analysis of MYMIV-Sb with other yellow mosaic virus isolates infecting legumes established
    dichotomy of the isolates into two species, namely, MYMIV and mungbean yellow mosaic virus
    (MYMV). The involvement of at least two distinct viruses in the etiology of soybean YMD in
    India is reported. <br>There are conflicting reports about genetics of resistance to MYMV.
    However, in most cases susceptibility has been shown to be dominant and governed by two genes.
    The strains can be distinguished from each other. <br>At present essentially two sources of
    resistance is being used in AICRP on soybean, namely G. Max cv. UPSM-534 and the wild species
    G. sojae (Ram et al., 1984) . There is an urgent need to identify newer sources of resistance
    and to understand the nature of resistance."

- title: "Screening of Soybean Genotypes for Resistance against Stem Fly (Melanagromyza sojae Zehnt.)"
  authors: "Awasthi, M.K. ;A..N. Sharma and R.R.Deshpande"
  abstract: "  Thirty-five soybean genotypes comprising of advanced breeding lines, germplasm lines, released
    varieties and farmers. selections were evaluated for resistance against three major
    insect-pests, viz. stem fly, girdle beetle and green semilooper. Some new parameters that have
    direct impact on grain yield have been used to categorize the genotypes into resistance groups.
    Accordingly, breeding lines . B14P58-59, D2P11, D2P23, D2P25, D3P6, D3P8, D3P23, D4P20, D6P18,
    D6P22, released variety - JS 93-05, and farmers. selections - Samart, Sel.-280, Sel.-1040,
    Sel.120, JS 93-05 and Sel. 2002 were found to possess multiple insect resistance. <br>Soybean,
    Glycine max (L.) Merrill, is attacked by about twenty different major insect pests. Out of
    these, stem fly (Melanagromyza sojae), girdle beetle (Oberiopsis brevis) and green semilooper
    (Chrysodexcis acuta) are predominant in central part of the country, which contribute about 70
    % of area and production. These insect-pests account for more than 25 % reduction in yield. The
    most economical way to deal with these insect-pests and avoid yield losses, is to cultivate
    insect resistant / tolerant varieties. Hybridization, involving identified resistant sources
    and agronomically suitable genotypes, is in progress at National Research Centre for Soybean
    (NRCS), Indore (M.P.). Several advanced generation progenies have exhibited good yield
    potential. But their response against major insect-pests was not deciphered. In order to
    identify potential resistant genotypes against stem fly, girdle beetle and green semilooper
    field screening was carried out using more relevant screening criteria."

- title: "Soybean Cultivar Identification Within a Selected Group Using Only an Agarose Gel System with Simple Sequence Repeat DNA Markers"
  authors: "Prashant Bommi and David L. Ferguson"
  abstract: "  This research focuses on the feasibility of using only high-resolution agarose gel
    electrophoresis with simple sequence repeat (SSR) DNA markers to distinguish elite soybean
    [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivars. Most of the soybean research with SSR markers has utilized
    sequencing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We tested our ability to distinguish between
    four elite cultivars using only high-resolution agarose electrophoresis with eleven SSR makers.
    Fragment sizes differing by seven base pairs or more could be easily separated. Of the eleven
    SSR markers, five markers exhibited visible polymorphisms between the four cultivars. Two SSR
    markers were found that could distinguish between all four cultivars. These results indicate
    that this method could be used to identify cultivars within a much larger selected group.
    Although agarose gel electrophoresis does not have the precision of polyacrylamide gel
    electrophoresis, it might find great utility with SSR markers for soybean cultivar
    identification."

  authors: "Reid G. Palmer and A. Assibi Mahama"
  abstract: "  In soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], five necrotic root mutants have been identified. Three were
    recovered among germinal revertant progeny of the w4-mutable line (Palmer et al., 1989) and
    they are allelic (Kosslak et al., 1996). Twenty three necrotic root mutants were identified in
    a second gene tagging study with the w4-mutable line. One has been tested and was allelic to
    the three from w4-mutable (Andersen and Palmer, 1997). The fifth characterized necrotic root
    mutant was identified in family EMS-95 which was descended from EMS treated cultivar AgriPro
    1776 (Palmer and Wubben, 1998). This EMS mutant necrotic root line was allelic to the previous
