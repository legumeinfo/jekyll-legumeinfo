  document: "The Soybean Genetics Committee met February 22, 1999 at the Sheraton Inn, St. Louis, MO in
    conjunction with the Soybean Breeder's Workshop. Committee members attending the meeting
    included P.R. Arelli, G.R. Buss, E.R. Cober, P.B. Cregan, B.W. Diers, R.J. Fioritto, R.L.
    Nelson, and T.W. Pfeiffer. G.R. Buss and E.R. Cober were elected by mail ballot to serve
    three-year terms on the committee. P.R. Arelli was elected chair for the year ending February,
    2000. Current members and February expiration dates for their terms on the committee
    are:<br>P.R. Arelli (2000) (Chair) agroara@showme.missouri.edu <br>G.R. Buss (2002)

    rnelson@uiuc.edu <br>T.W. Pfeiffer (2001) tpfeiffe@ca.uky.edu <br>Procedure<br>As in the past,
    manuscripts concerning gene symbols and linkages should be sent to the Chairperson of the
    Soybean Genetics Committee for review. To facilitate the review process, the Committee will
    proceed as follows:<br>1. The review will only be for 'validity of the genetic interpretation'
    and 'appropriateness of gene symbol.' Manuscripts will not be reviewed for style except as this
    influences the clarity of interpretation. Authors may submit unpolished (but comprehensible)
    manuscripts for review which should reduce delays involved in publishing a paper.<br>2.
    Reviewers of manuscripts will be given a deadline of four weeks to return the reviewed
    manuscript to the Chairperson who will then return it to the author as soon as possible. If the
    reviewers have not returned the manuscript by this time or have not phoned in their comments, a
    phone call will be made to remedy the situation. If authors have not received a reply within
    two months of submission, they should contact the Chairperson of the Soybean Genetics
    Committee.<br>Assignment/Approval of Gene Symbols<br>Seed samples containing named genes, and
    especially those from induced mutants, variants from heterogeneous populations, or from
    transgenic changes should be deposited in the Genetic Type Collection. Dr. R.L. Nelson is the
    curator for all maturity groups. Click here for an application form.<br>Gene symbols will be
    approved in cases where the relevant (germplasm) material is made available for subsequent
    allelism testing. The Committee encourages authors not to assign any symbol when they are doing
    genetic work on material that will not be made publicly available. (Publication of genetic
    interpretation does not depend upon symbols, in most cases.) The purpose of assigning a symbol
    is to ensure constancy when others use the material for subsequent studies. If the material is
    not made available, a symbol is not necessary.<br>New Business<br>There was discussion at the
    committee meeting on whether reports from the coordination sessions of the Soybean Breeder's
    Workshop should be posted on the internet as part of the Soybean Genetics Newsletter Website.
    Both the benefits and disadvantages of posting this information were discussed. A decision was
    made that this information should not be posted on the internet at this time.<br>Gene
