- title: "Inheritance of Resistance to Phytophthora sojae in the Soybean PI 567574A"
  authors: "R. A. Leitz, C. D. Nickell, and G. L. Hartman"
  abstract: "  Phytophthora root rot of soybean can cause heavy crop losses. Monogenic race-specific resistance
    to the causal organism, Phytophthora sojae, is controlled by 13 dominant alleles at seven loci
    in soybean. Soybean germplasm lines have been identified with new race resistance patterns.
    These lines need to be characterized to determine the inheritance of that resistance and
    compared to known sources of resistance. The objective of this study was to characterize the
    inheritance of resistance to P. sojae in PI 567574A. Results indicate that there are two
    alleles at independent loci that control resistance in this PI. Allelism studies indicated that
    the two alleles are Rps1c and Rps3a."

  authors: "Marco T. Buenrostro-Nava1,3, Holly M. Frantz1, Peter P. Ling2 and John J. Finer1,4"
  abstract: "  Recent advances in machine vision technology have resulted in an increase in the use of image
    analysis in different areas of cell biology. Image analysis has been used to study in
    vitro-grown animal cells using light microscopy (Gauthier et al., 1992) and the movement and
    compartmentalization of proteins in plant cells using confocal microscopy (Haseloff and
    Siemering, 1998).<br>In the area of plant developmental biology, image analysis has been
    utilized with tissue culture systems to collect information on tissue growth and development.
    Smith et al. (1989) were the first to use image analysis as a non-invasive method to evaluate
    growth of in vitro cultures of some woody, vegetables and grass plants. Computer vision
    techniques were later used to follow the kinetics of somatic embryo formation in suspension
    cultures of carrot (Cazzulino et al., 1990; Ibaraki et al., 1996). In order to select coffee
    somatic embryos with high germination efficiency, Ling et al. (1996) used machine vision to
    first establish the relationship between the elongation coefficient and the growth aspect ratio
    of mature embryos and then determine the ability of those embryos to germinate. Using computer
    analysis to evaluate size, shape and color-related measurements from images of sweet potato
    somatic embryos (during torpedo and cotyledonary-stage), Padmanabhan et al. (1998a) identified
    germination-competent and non-competent embryo types and then compared these characteristics
    with the embryo anatomy using histological analysis (Padmanabhan et al.,1998b). These reports
    demonstrated the potential of image analysis for embryo growth studies. However, to our
    knowledge, there are no reports on the use of image analysis to evaluate growth of somatic
    embryos from their earliest developmental stage or using computer animation to better
    understand embryo development and growth over time. For most analysis of plant biological
    systems, evaluations are still based on human vision and results can often be highly variable
    and very subjective. This makes comparisons difficult with qualitative data from different
    laboratories.<br>The objective of this work was to demonstrate the capability of characterizing
    somatic embryo development using image analysis and animation techniques."

- title: "Segregation for Stem Canker resistance in Southern Soybean crosses"
  authors: "J. Tyler"
  abstract: "  Stem Canker caused by Diaporthe phaseolorum (Cooke & Ellis) Sacc. f. sp. meridionalis
    Morgan-Jones (Dpm) can cause significant yield losses in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in
    the southern USA. Some cultivars are resistant. The parental donor of resistance is unknown for
    many cultivars, therefore it is not known which genes are the most common in the elite
    germplasm base. Progeny from 44 resistant X resistant soybean genetic populations were
    evaluated for their reaction to the fungus causing stem canker disease. Susceptible progeny
    were identified in only 8 populations. The frequency of susceptible plants in those was low.
    This indicates that few loci are represented in the current elite breeding gene pool. An
    implication from the study is that breeders can delay testing for stem canker resistance until
    very late phases of development if both parents are resistant."

- title: "RAPD Markers Associated with Salt Tolerance In Wild Soybean Populations"
  authors: "Q. Zhang, H. Wang, and  Z. Hu"
  abstract: "  Salinity is a major environmental constraint to crop production in the arid and semi-arid regions
    of the world (Greenway and Munns 1980). Most crop plants including wild soybeans are sensitive
    to salt stress. Sources of salt tolerance have been identified among some related wild species.
    These genetic resources could potentially be used to improve salt tolerance of soybean
    cultivars.<br>One approach to facilitate the selection and breeding for complex traits such as
    salt tolerance is the identification and utilization of simply inherited genetic markers that
    are genetically associated with the trait of interest (Tanksley 1993; Foolad et al., 1995). In
    previous study, we employed isozymes and RAPDs as genetic markers to identify the relationship
    between the markers and salt-tolerance. Little correlation was found (Wang et al., 1997). The
    present investigation was conducted to further examine randomly amplified polymorphism DNA
    (RAPD) markers associated with salt tolerance and therefore to study the molecular mechanisms
    of adaptation of wild soybean to changing saline conditions."

  authors: "J. D. Burzlaff, and R. G. Palmer"
  abstract: "  Amberger et al., (1992) reported that the Chinese cultivar Jilin 3 (PI 427099 [GRIN]) was very
    conducive to generate variants from tissue culture. Among the progeny of a chimeric foliage
    plant (LA55-1) identified in the R3 generation, were plants with green foliage, chimeric
    foliage, and yellow viable, and yellow lethal plants. The yellow viable mutant was allelic to
    y20 [Soybase] and the yellow lethal mutant was allelic to y18 [Soybase]. These data will be
    reported elsewhere. Our objective was to determine linkage relationships of these two mutants
    with morphological and isoenzyme mutants in soybean."

- title: "Inheritance of Partial Resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in Soybean Cultivars Asgrow A2506 and Novartis S19-90"
  authors: "D. D. Hoffman1, A. D. Nickell2, C. D. Nickell1, B.W. Diers1, and G. L. Hartman1"
  abstract: "  Partial resistance to Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), [Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary] has
    been identified in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] accessions and cultivars in the United
    States. There have been no reports of the inheritance of partial resistance to S. sclerotiorum
    in soybean. The objectives of this study were to: (i) estimate the number of genes contributing
    to resistance to S. sclerotiorum in the soybean cultivars Asgrow A2506 and Novartis S19-90 and
    (ii) estimate broad and narrow sense heritabilities. Data from greenhouse evaluations of three
    crosses, Asgrow WR2347 x Asgrow A2506, Novartis S19-90 x Asgrow A2506, and Novartis S19-90 x
    Asgrow WR2347, were used to estimate goodness of fit for theoretical inheritance models in F2
    and F3 generations and to estimate heritabilities. We found significant results indicating
    partial resistance to S. sclerotiorum is caused by multiple genes and some may be recessive.
    Estimates of heritabilities indicated more dominance occurred when Novartis S19-90 was used as
    a parental line compared with Asgrow A2506. All heritability estimates based on F2:3 family
    means (>0.86) were higher than the heritability estimates based on F2 plant basis. This
    presages selection for partial resistance to S. sclerotiorum in soybean based on F2:3 family
    means evaluation would be more efficient than selecting on a single F2 plant basis. The high
    heritability estimates in our greenhouse evaluations are valuable to soybean breeders selecting
    for partial resistance to S. sclerotiorum."

- title: "Influence of wp on Pod Characteristics and Agronomic Traits of Soybean Lines"
  authors: "D. C. Gay, J. M. Hegstad, P. A. Stephens, and C. D. Nickell"
  abstract: "  Homozygous recessive wp alleles produce pink flower color in soybean when in the presence of the
    non-allelic gene W1[Soybase] by modifying the expression of purple pigmentation (Stephens and
    Nickell, 1992). Stephens et al. (1993) found no differences between pink and near-isogenic
    purple-flowered soybean lines for the agronomic traits yield, maturity, height, lodging, and
    seed quality. Pink flower soybeans differ from magenta flowered soybeans, which have the
    genotype W1_wmwm[Soybase]. Magenta flower color lines were associated with a 3% reduction in
    yield, attributed to a lower photosynthetic rate and earlier leaf senescence compared with
    purple-flowered Harosoy[GRIN] (Buzzell et al., 1977). <br>Stephens et al. (1993) observed that
    two-seeded pods were more prevalent in pink flowered lines, while purple-flowered lines
    produced proportionally more three-seeded pods. However, seeds per pod or pods per plant were
    not counted to determine the possible effect of wp upon pod characteristics. In petunia and
    maize, it was determined that flavonols are required in the pollen grain to initiate pollen
    tube growth and ensure successful fertilization (Taylor, 1995). The most diverse group of
    flavonol compounds is the anthocyanins, which generate pigmentation in floral tissues. In
    soybean, the wp locus is thought to modify anthocyanin production to generate pink flowers
    instead of purple flowers, however it is unknown if there is a relationship between anthocyanin
    modification and seeds per pod, or pods per plant.<br>Other studies have found a relationship
    between leaflet shape and seeds per pod (Bernard and Weiss, 1973). The recessive gene
    ln[Soybase] is responsible for both narrow leaflet shape and a predominance of four-seeded
    pods. Another gene for leaflet shape, lo[Soybase], is associated with few-seeded pods (Domingo,
    1945). <br>In the literature, there are no reports relating flower color with seeds per pod or
    loculi per pod. The objective of this study was to describe the influence of wp upon pod
    characteristics and agronomic traits when crossed into a different genetic background."

- title: "The Effect of Selection Method on the Association of Yield and Seed Protein with Agronomic Characters in an Interspecific Cross of Soybean"
  authors: "Li Xinhai1, Wang Jinling1,Yang Qingkai1, Jiao Shaojie2, and Wang Liming2"
  abstract: "  Correlations of seed yield and protein percentage of soybeans (Glycine max) were variable. Seed
    protein content was both positively and negatively associated with maturity (Kwon and Torrie
    1964; Weiss et al. 1952). Close relationships between protein content and either plant height
    or lodging were not reported (Johnson et al. 1955a). In general, high seed yield was associated
    with low protein percentage (Byth et al. 1969; Hartwig 1969; Hymowitz et al. 1972; Johnson et
    al. 1955b), although positive correlations between those two traits were also observed among
    progenies of some crosses (Kwon and Torrie 1964; Weiss et al. 1952). With respect to components
    of yield, protein content has been positively and negatively associated with number of fruiting
    nodes per plant and with number of seeds per pod, and has been positively associated with seed
    size (Fehr and Weber 1968). In two populations, an inverse relationship was reported between
    protein content and resistance to shattering (Johnson et al. 1955b)."

- title: "The Effects of Daylength on the Growth of Soybean and the Creation of Wide-adaptation Germplasm"
  authors: "Guiru Zhang and Weiguang Du"
  abstract: "  There are plenty of reports about the photoperiodic response of soybean. The early studies were
    mainly focused on the effect of daylength on blooming stage. Further studies showed that
    daylength influences, not only the development of soybean before flowering, but also the
    development between flowering and maturity (Major 1975, Akhanda et al. 1981, Liu et al. 1983).
    He et al. (1993) and Han et al. (1995) investigated the post-flowering photoperiodic responses
    of soybean by treating soybean with different daylengths before and after flowering. These
    studies together proved that photoperiod affects the whole growth and development period, but
    few studies have associated photoperiod with yield characters and creation of wide-adaptation
    lines of soybean.<br>The goal of this study was to understand the response of cultivars to
    different daylengths and to create daylength insensitive germplasm. These will provide
    knowledge and material for high-yield breeding and photoperiodic breeding of soybean."

  authors: "A. D. Jenks, R. A. Leitz, and C. D. Nickell"
  abstract: "  Phytophthora root rot, caused by Phytophthora sojae, has been a very harmful disease in soybeans
    for many years. Recent crop loss estimates have ranked Phytophthora root rot as the second or
    third most destructive disease for soybeans (Doupnik, 1993). Resistance to Phytophthora in
    soybeans is controlled by thirteen dominant genes. There are fifty-three known races of the
    pathogen (Ryley et al., 1998). The pathogen may attack plants in all stages of growth with
    disease development favored by poorly drained soils and cool wet weather (Moots, et al., 1988)."

  authors: "D.J. Weber, R.A. Leitz, and C.D. Nickell"
  abstract: "  The soilborn fungus Phytophthora sojae causes the disease Phytophthora root rot. The disease can
    attack soybeans at any stage of development. Seed rot and pre-emergence damping-off can occur
    in flooded areas or ponded soils. Post-emergence damping-off and seedling stem rot cause
    wilting and plant death (Schmitthenner, 1985). Plant Introduction (PI) 567.504 is resistant to
    hypocotyl inoculation of races 1, 4, 7, 13, and 25 and susceptible to races 3, 5, 12, and 20.
    Hegstad et al. (1998) suggested on the basis of RFLP analysis that PI 567.504 carries the Rps3a
    gene for resistance to P. sojae. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic
    control of resistance to P. sojae race 25 in PI 567.504."
