- title: "Prospects of exploiting of photoperiod sensitivity gene E7 in early soybean breeding and revealing of its sources with SSR-markers"

  abstract: "  Abstract<br>Recently described gene E7 for photoperiod sensitivity in soybean is prospective for
    the development of early cultivars. Field trials of isolines differing in 7/e7 revealed yield
    gain equal to 21% while maturity was delayed by 6 days. Weak effect (4-5 days of flowering
    delay) makes distinguishing of 7 by means of hybridologic analysis somewhat complicated.
    Screening of germplasm collection for 7 sources with SSR-markers allowed identification a
    number of cultivars possessing this allele within different maturity groups (00 to II)."

- title: "Gene duplication in soybean and polymorphism in the steroid biosynthesis pathway indicate highly conserved gene sequences"

  abstract: "  Abstract<br>The steroid biosynthesis pathway is responsible for producing several important
    biochemicals and precursor molecules. The KEGG database renders an authoritative view of the
    interactions in this pathway. We used this and other online resources to design PCR primers
    based primarily on soybean expressed sequence tags (ESTs). A total of 50 gene-based primer
    pairs (38 soybean, 12 alternative) were tested for function and four polymorphism states on two
    soybean breeding lines. A total of nine genes exhibited a single, monomorphic amplification
    product and four amplified a single polymorphic fragment. The production of 13 multiple
    monomorphic products and ten multiple products that included at least one polymorphism was also
    observed. A total of 14 primer pairs failed to produce a clear amplification product. The
    sequences used to design these primers were tested against an initial scaffold build of soybean
    genomic sequences consisting of 950 Mbp of DNA. These data indicate that directed analysis of a
    biochemical pathway can yield multiple opportunities to identify specific genic polymorphisms
    in soybean, while taking into consideration the duplicated nature of the genome."
