- title: "Use of gametocide for emasculation in Soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.)"
  authors: "S K Lal*, C Devkumar (1), R L Sapra and K P Singh, Division of Genetics, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, 1-Division of Agriculture Chemicals, IARI, New Delhi"
  abstract: "  Hybridization is a tedious operation in soybean. Gametocides have been used in a number of crops
    to induce male-sterility either for hybrid seed production or as a substitute for hand
    emasculation. However, there is no report of use of gametocide on Soybean. Ethyl
    4'fluorooxanilate at the rate of 1000 ppm was used for inducing male -sterility. Preliminary
    study shows that the pollen sterility varied from 20.03% to 55.55% in the treated samples as
    compared to 1.37% to 2.63% in the control. The effectiveness of the gametocide can be improved
    by increasing the quantity of the gametocide used or by spraying at an appropriate stage. Even
    with 50% sterility it can be successfully used in combination with a dominant morphological
    marker for emasculation."

- title: "Induced Variation in Quantitative Traits due to Physical (gamma rays), Chemical (EMS) and combined Mutagen Treatments in Soybean [Glycine max (L.)Merrill]"
  authors: "Archana Patil, Taware S. P. and Raut V. M."
  abstract: "  Indian Soybean variety, MACS-450 has semi determinate growth habit, medium maturity and high
    yield potential which is very well adapted to agro-climatic conditions of Southern India. Seeds
    of this variety were exposed to various doses of Y rays, ethyl methane sulphonate and
    combination of both. Observations on percentage germination, percentage leaf abnormalities,
    percentage survival, days to maturity, plant height, pods per plant, seed weight per plant and
    yield kg/ha were recorded on M1 generation. Likewise percentage reduction in various
    quantitative characters through various treatments was also recorded. The results indicate dose
    related effect of mutagenic treatments on quantitative traits. 20 to 25 Kr Y rays dose and 0.10
    to 0.20% EMS dose may be optimum to obtain maximum variations in qualitative as well as
    quantitative traits in M2 population."

- title: "Identification and sequence analysis of a RAPD marker tightly linked to the Rsv1 locus in soybean"
  authors: "Z. Li , R. L. Nelson, R. L. Bernard, and Y. Peng"
  abstract: "  'Williams' and three near-isogenic lines (isolines) with soybean mosaic virus (SMV) resistance
    were used to identify a random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker linked to the locus
    conferring resistance to SMV. A RAPD marker was found to be present in Williams and absent in
    three isolines of Williams with SMV resistance. Three F2 populations developed from the crosses
    of Williams x L81-4420, Williams x L92-8151, and Marshall x Kanro were produced to verify the
    linkage between the fragment and SMV resistance gene. A 1,000 base pair fragment, designated
    OPN-111000, generated by the primer OPN-11 was located approximately 1.2&plusmn;1.2 cM in
    repulsion phase and 1.8&plusmn;1.3 cM in coupling phase from Rsv1, a gene for resistance to
    SMV. In a survey of other germplasm, OPN-111000 was found linked with either Rsv1 or rsv1. F3
    families derived from F2 resistant plants were used to confirm the F2 genotypes. Using this
    marker, homozygous and heterozygous SMV resistant plants could be easily distinguished based on
    the fragment intensity. By cloning and sequencing the fragment, the RAPD marker was converted
    to a SCAR marker. This SCAR marker can be used reliably for marker-assisted selection of Rsv1
    locus, map-based cloning or further SNP marker development."
