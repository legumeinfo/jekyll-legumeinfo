    attendance: Jennifer Yates, Pengyin Chen, and several guests.<br>Brief review of cases and SGC
    decisions from Feb 08 to Feb 09<br>1. Confirmation of two recessive seed phytic acid QTL:
    cqPha-001 (on Chrom 3/LG N) and cqPha-002 (on Chrom 19/LG L). Confirmation status was requested
    by Andrew Scaboo (former M.S. student with Vince Pantalone at the Univ. of Tennessee) in
    February 2008 (Manuscript: Scaboo et al.; submitted to Crop Sci.).<br>2. Recommended and
    approved naming a soybean rust resistance gene Rpp1-b.<br>Brian Diers (Univ. of Illinois) had
    requested approval to name a resistance gene on Chrom 18/LG G of PI 549538A Rpp1b in June 2008
    (Manuscript: Chakraborty et al.). The SGC recommended insertion of the dash to comply with
    nomenclature rules.<br>3. Recommended adoption of the name Ncl2 for a dominant salt tolerance
    gene from G. soja accession PI 483463, and assigning Ncl1to a previously reported salt
    tolerance gene from G. max line S-100. Grover Shannon (Univ. of Missouri, Portageville) had
    requested permission to assign the symbol Ncl-Gs to the G. soja gene in July 2008 (Manuscript:
    Lee et al.). Authors concluded from 15:1 segregation for tolerance:sensitivity among F2:3
    families from a cross of G. max S-100, PI 483463 that the G. soja gene was different from a
    salt tolerance gene previously identified in S-100.<br>4. Recommended naming a newly mapped
    maturity gene locus E8E8 on the basis of evidence that it is independent from previously named
    maturity loci. Elroy Cober (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) requested advice on naming the
    new locus in September 2008. (Manuscript: Cober et al.)<br>5. The SGC received a manuscript
    from Curt Hill (Univ. of Illinois) in September regarding an aphid resistance gene from PI
    200538 that maps to the same region on LG F as Rag2 (from PI 243540). The SGC decided that this
    did not really fall under the Committee's jurisdiction, since the authors were not proposing a
    new name for the gene that they had mapped. <br>6. Approved recognition status and naming an
    SCN resistance QTL on LG D2 as cqSCN-005. David Lightfoot (Southern Illinois Univ.) requested
    recognition of confirmation status for this QTL in December 2008 (Manuscript by Kazi et
    al.).<br>7. Received requests from Dechun Wang (Michigan State Univ.) for approval of gene
    symbols for recessive aphid antibiosis resistance genes from PI 567598B (rag1b on LG M), PI
    567541B (rag4 on LG F, and rag1c), and for a recessive aphid antixenosis gene from PI 567543C
    (rag3b). The Committee did not make a ruling on these requests, but they were discussed at the
    meeting, and they illustrated the need for nomenclature that can be applied to genes and QTLs
    that have not yet been confirmed by the SGC, but which scientists may want to include in
    presentations prior to an SGC ruling. (More information on the discussion is provided
    below.)<br>C. General issues discussed and/or voted on:<br>1. Dr. Jennifer Yates (Monsanto,
    Galena, MD) and Dr. Pengyin Chen (Univ. of Arkansas) were confirmed as the two new members from
    North America.<br>2. A motion was passed to increase the number of members in the Soybean
    Genetics Committee to include members from outside of North America. Another motion was passed
    to expand the committee by four international members, adding two in 2009 and two more in 2010.
    After that, additional international members would be elected to replace members rotating off
    of the Committee, in order to maintain a complement of four international members. The intent
    of the motion passed is to keep a balance between the number of representatives from Asia and
    South America, since these are the other continents on which extensive soybean genetic research
    is being conducted.<br>3. Bill Schapaugh and David Walker were elected as co-chairs of the SGC
    to serve from February 2009 to February 2010. Rouf Mian and Jim Narvel rotated off of the
    Committee.<br>4. The proportion of SGC members needed to support a proposed gene name or on
    confirmation status for a QTL before it could be considered an SGC decision was discussed, and
    a motion was passed to adopt decisions based on a simple majority (i.e., >50% of the members
    supporting it).<br>5. A motion was passed to give the ex-officio members (currently Randy
    Nelson and David Grant) voting rights. Although this privilege had been assumed, there was
    apparently nothing in writing to confirm it.<br>6. A discussion was initiated about the need to
    revise the existing gene nomenclature rules from 1997 in order to solve incompatibility
    problems between some of the existing nomenclature rules and the SoyBase database. David Grant,
    Dave Hyten and David Walker will draft a revision of the rules to submit to the SGC for
    commentary.<br>7. A need for nomenclature rules for gene names proposed by researchers, but not
    yet confirmed by the SGC, was also discussed. This was prompted by Dechun Wang's request to
    have several aphid resistance gene names approved prior to a presentation that he was to give
    the following day. In other cases, researchers may wish to 'reserve' a name when they feel that
    they have sufficient data to support either a novel locus or likely allelism with a previously
    reported gene. There was some concern about using the proposed name without any indication that
    it had not yet been approved by the Committee. Some SGC members advocate using a unique gene
    name for unconfirmed genes, an arrangement with precedence in some other plant genetics
    communities. Other members were concerned about the fact that the name initially used for a
    gene tends to stick, and that having two unique names for the same gene might cause unnecessary
    confusion. A compromise was proposed in the use of the postscript '_provisional' to indicate
    that a particular gene name had not yet been confirmed by Committee vote. For example, the
    aphid resistance gene from PI 567598B would be named 'rag1-b_provisional'. A suggestion was
    also made that authors be allowed to use this 'provisional' nomenclature in only one
    manuscript, and that the next manuscript should provide evidence for confirmation or rejection
    of the original name. This proposed nomenclature rule was accepted tentatively, but appeared to
    warrant further debate and discussion.<br>8. There was also a discussion about the used of
    chromosome numbers and linkage group designations, and the need for a Soybean Genetics
    Committee policy regarding this. A debate took place about the validity of chromosome numbers
    that had been assigned on the basis of genetic length instead of using cytogenetics studies
    with primary trisomics. The point was raised that the DOE-Joint Genome Institute sequencing
    project had insisted on using chromosome numbers instead of molecular linkage group names,
    which had forced the issue. The JGI might have assigned numbers arbitrarily to the nine
    unnumbered linkage groups if members of the soybean genetics community had not advocated
    assignment of chromosome numbers to the remaining linkage groups on the basis of genetic
    length. Although some members were uncomfortable with the method used, a majority agreed that
    with the release of the Williams 82 sequence by the JGI, it would be difficult or impossible at
    this point to halt the use of the chromosome numbers used in that project. However, it was also
    pointed out that with the extensive use of Linkage Group names in the literature, it will be
    helpful to provide both Chromosome number and Linkage Group name in articles. Therefore, the
    Soybean Genetics Committee voted to encourage authors to use the appropriate Chromosome number
    followed by the corresponding Linkage Group name."
