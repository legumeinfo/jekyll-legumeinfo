  abstract: "  Abstract<br>Seeds of these two soybean genotypes viz., Pusa-16 and PK-1042 were exposed to
    various doses of gamma rays, ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) and combination of both.
    Observations on germination %, lethality % (30 days after sowing and at flowering) and pollen
    sterility were recorded on M1 generation. The results indicated that a reduction in the
    germination percent over control was noticed in all the mutagenic treatments in both the
    cultivars. In general, reduction in germination percent was associated with the increase in the
    dose/concentration of the mutagen. The LD-50 for Pusa-16 was found to lie between 30KR + 0.2%
    EMS and 45 kR + 0.2% EMS, while in PK-1042, it was found to lie between 30 kR and 45 kR gamma
    rays and in between the higher doses/concentrations of combined treatment. In case of pollen
    sterility combined treatment exhibited high percentage of pollen sterility followed by EMS and
    gamma-rays. In Pusa-16, the increase in the dose/concentration of gamma rays and EMS was
    associated with the increase in the pollen sterility percent, while in combined treatment, the
    increase was noticed upto the intermediate dose level followed by decrease at higher level. On
    the other hand in PK-1042, increase in EMS concentration was associated with increase in
    sterility percent, while no definite trend was noticed in gamma rays and combined
    treatment.<br>Key words: Gamma rays, EMS, germination, lethality, pollen sterility, soybean."

- title: "EVOLUTIONARY ASPECTS MICROSPOROGENESIS AND MICROGAMETOGENESIS INTERSPECIFIC HYBRIDS WITHIN THE GENUS Glycine L."
  authors: "Margarita Kozak"
  abstract: "  Abstract <br>A cytogenetic study of interspecific Glycine max & G. soja
    hybrids was made. The F1 - F2 meiosis and pollen formation was studied on preparations stained
    by Felgen and by acetokarmin. The range in pollen diameter variability of interspecific hybrids
    proved significant: 9, 6-31, 2 mkm, and giving evidence of some meiotic disturbances in the
    process of microsporogenesis. Chromosomes of interspecific hybrids are from desynaped bivalents
    univalents during diakinesis - metaphase-I. The interspecific hybrid chromosome composition
    arises because of chromosome dissimilarity caused by the taxonomic differences in soja bean
    species under study. Genome isolation in hybrids and chromosome conjugation within each of the
    genomes confirmed the hypothesis on the leading role of polyploidy in the phylogeny of G. max
    and G. soja.<br>Keywords: Glycine max, G. soja (G. ussuriensis), wild soybean, phylogeny,
    Interspecific hybrid, Microsporogenesis, meiosis, Microgametogenesis, pollen."
