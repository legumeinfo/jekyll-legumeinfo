      abstract: "A significant effort to sequence a large number of soybean germplasm
        lines in the U.S. through the project titled \"Large Scale Sequencing of
        Germplasm to Develop Genomic Resources for Soybean Improvement\",
        generated genome sequence information for the most diverse soybean lines
        from the USDA-GRIN germplasm collection. This sequencing project was
        supported by the United Soybean Board and three private companies: Bayer
        CropScience, DOW AgroSciences, LLC, and Monsanto. Dr. Henry Nguyen,
        Division of Plant Sciences, College of Agriculture, Food and Natural
        Resources, University of Missouri is the Principal Investigator of this
        project and Dr. Babu Valliyodan, Nguyen's Laboratory at the University
        of Missouri is coordinating this research. This is the first large-scale
        public-private partnership of this magnitude in the soybean genetic
        research arena. The results of this project will lay the groundwork for
        future soybean genetics and breeding research. As part of this project,
        the southern U.S. soybean cultivar Lee (PI 548656) was selected for
        sequencing to create a second reference genome in soybean. This will
        complement the first reference genome, Williams82, that was chosen to
        represent the northern U.S. germplasm. The data generated by this
        project will benefit the soybean community and allow both public and
        private soybean breeders and researchers to use these resources to
        improve soybean varieties for U.S. farmers."

      abstract: "Soybean is one of the most important food crops globally. It is a major source of both protein and oil for humans, livestock and fish. In addition, its industrial usages include soy-based products and biodiesel production. In the United States, the total value of the soybean crop is $40 billion annually. Unfortunately, over 20% of the soybean yield is suppressed annually by abiotic and biotic stresses, which is expected to deteriorate due to climate change. Use of new genetic mechanisms to address abiotic and biotic stresses supports sustainable, environmentally benign soybean production, without additional input or cultivation costs. Development of cultivars with robust responses to abiotic and biotic stresses requires identification of the best alleles from across a broad germplasm collection. Identification and use of new genetic mechanisms to fight the abiotic and biotic stresses is considered ideal for sustainable soybean production because it does not add any additional costs to cultivation and is environmentally friendly. To reduce the losses from abiotic and biotic stresses, it is necessary to discover and develop superior soybean lines that can be used to develop genetically superior commercial cultivars. The rationale of the proposed research is that once we identify the desirable genetic stocks carrying genes for tolerances to abiotic and biotic stresses, it will be possible to design desirable cultivars that will sustain soybean production under environmental stress conditions."

      abstract: "The gene content of plants varies between individuals of the same species due to gene presence/absence variation, and selection can alter the frequency of specific genes in a population. Selection during domestication and breeding will modify the genomic landscape, though the nature of these modifications is only understood for specific genes or on a more general level (e.g., by a loss of genetic diversity). Here we have assembled and analyzed a soybean (Glycine spp.) pangenome representing more than 1,000 soybean accessions derived from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection, including both wild and cultivated lineages, to assess genomewide changes in gene and allele frequency during domestication and breeding. We identified 3,765 genes that are absent from the Lee reference genome assembly and assessed the presence/absence of all genes across this population. In addition to a loss of genetic diversity, we found a significant reduction in the average number of protein-coding genes per individual during domestication and subsequent breeding, though with some genes and allelic variants increasing in frequency associated with selection for agronomic traits. This analysis provides a genomic perspective of domestication and breeding in this important oilseed crop."

      abstract: "Cultivated soybean (Glycine max) suffers from a narrow germplasm relative to other crop species, probably because of under-use of wild soybean (Glycine soja) as a breeding resource. Use of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array is a promising method for dissecting cultivated and wild germplasms to identify important adaptive genes through high-density genetic mapping and genome-wide association studies. Here we describe a large soybean SNP array for use in diversity analyses, linkage mapping and genome-wide association analyses. More than four million high-quality SNPs identified from high-depth genome re-sequencing of 16 soybean accessions and low-depth genome re-sequencing of 31 soybean accessions were used to select 180,961 SNPs for creation of the Axiom(®) SoyaSNP array. Validation analysis for a set of 222 diverse soybean lines showed that 170,223 markers were of good quality for genotyping. Phylogenetic and allele frequency analyses of the validation set data indicated that accessions showing an intermediate morphology between cultivated and wild soybeans collected in Korea were natural hybrids. More than 90 unanchored scaffolds in the current soybean reference sequence were assigned to chromosomes using this array. Finally, dense average spacing and preferential distribution of the SNPs in gene-rich chromosomal regions suggest that this array may be suitable for genome-wide association studies of soybean germplasm. Taken together, these results suggest that use of this array may be a powerful method for soybean genetic analyses relating to many aspects of soybean breeding."

      abstract: "Understanding diversity and evolution of a crop is an essential step to implement a strategy to expand its germplasm base for crop improvement research. Accessions intensively collected from Korea, which is a small but central region in the distribution geography of soybean, were genotyped to provide sufficient data to underpin population genetic questions. After removing natural hybrids and duplicated or redundant accessions, we obtained a non-redundant set comprising 1957 domesticated and 1079 wild accessions to perform population structure analyses. Our analysis demonstrates that while wild soybean germplasm will require additional sampling from diverse indigenous areas to expand the germplasm base, the current domesticated soybean germplasm is saturated in terms of genetic diversity. We then showed that our genome-wide polymorphism map enabled us to detect genetic loci underlying flower color, seed-coat color, and domestication syndrome. A representative soybean set consisting of 194 accessions was divided into one domesticated subpopulation and four wild subpopulations that could be traced back to their geographic collection areas. Population genomics analyses suggested that the monophyletic group of domesticated soybeans was likely originated at a Japanese region. The results were further substantiated by a phylogenetic tree constructed from domestication-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in this study."

When sampling random subsets of these accessions, the number of variants and tag SNPs plateaued beyond approximately 800 and 600 accessions, respectively. This suggests extensive coverage of diversity within the cultivated soybean. GmHapMap variants were imputed onto 21 618 previously genotyped accessions with up to 96% success for common alleles. A local association analysis was performed with the imputed data using markers located in a 1-Mb region known to contribute to seed oil content and enabled us to identify a candidate causal SNP residing in the NPC1 gene. We determined gene-centric haplotypes (407 867 GCHs) for the 55 589 genes and showed that such haplotypes can help to identify alleles that differ in the resulting phenotype. Finally, we predicted 18 031 putative loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in 10 662 genes and illustrated how such a resource can be used to explore gene function. The GmHapMap provides a unique worldwide resource for applied soybean genomics and breeding."

      abstract: "A gene-centric approach for haplotype definition was developed and implemented in R. The tool allows for allelic characterization at given loci in germplasm collections. Allelic status at four maturity genes is predicted on the basis of marker genotyping data. Assessing the allelic diversity within a germplasm collection and identifying individuals carrying favorable alleles is challenging. Advances in high-throughput technologies allow the genotyping of many individuals for thousands of markers but bridging the gap between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and relevant alleles remains difficult. We developed a systematic approach that defines haplotypes from large SNP catalogs that aims to identify haplotypes that can be equated to alleles at given genes. Unlike haplotype visualization tools, our approach selects SNP markers that flank a gene and define haplotypes that correspond to this gene's alleles. We tested this approach on four known soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] maturity genes (E1, GmGia, GmPhyA3, and GmPhyA2) in a collection of 67 lines and two genotypic datasets [a SNP array and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)]. For E1, GmGia, and GmPhyA3, we identified SNP haplotypes such that the allele found at these genes could be accurately predicted from the haplotype in 97.3% of the cases. For these genes, of the 12 known alleles in the collection, 10 and 8 could be correctly predicted from the haplotypes found with the SNP array and GBS datasets, with success rates of 98 and 97% for all allele-line combinations, respectively. The approach proved equally successful for data derived from a SNP array and GBS. However, in the case of GmPhyA2, a lack of markers in the genomic region prevented the identification of alleles, regardless of the dataset. We demonstrate the feasibility and reproducibility of our approach and identify limits to its applicability."

      abstract: "Domestication of soybeans occurred under the intense human-directed selections aimed at developing high-yielding lines. Tracing the domestication history and identifying the genes underlying soybean domestication require further exploration. Here, we developed a high-throughput NJAU 355 K SoySNP array and used this array to study the genetic variation patterns in 367 soybean accessions, including 105 wild soybeans and 262 cultivated soybeans. The population genetic analysis suggests that cultivated soybeans have tended to originate from northern and central China, from where they spread to other regions, accompanied with a gradual increase in seed weight. Genome-wide scanning for evidence of artificial selection revealed signs of selective sweeps involving genes controlling domestication-related agronomic traits including seed weight. To further identify genomic regions related to seed weight, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted across multiple environments in wild and cultivated soybeans. As a result, a strong linkage disequilibrium region on chromosome 20 was found to be significantly correlated with seed weight in cultivated soybeans. Collectively, these findings should provide an important basis for genomic-enabled breeding and advance the study of functional genomics in soybean."

      abstract: "Crop-related wild species contain new sources of genetic diversity for crop improvement. Wild soybean (Glycine soja Sieb. and Zucc.) is the progenitor of cultivated soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and can be used as an essential genetic resource for yield improvements. In this research, using genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 96 out of 113 wild soybean accessions with 114,090 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (with minor allele frequencies ≤ 0.05), SNPs associated with five yield-related traits were identified across multiple environments. In total, 41 SNPs were significantly associated with the traits in two or more environments (significance threshold P ≤ 8.76 × 10–6), with 29, 7, 3, and 2 SNPs detected for 100-seed weight (SW), maturity time (MT), seed yield per plant (SY) and flowering time (FT), respectively. BLAST search against the Glycine soja W05 reference genome was performed, 20 candidate genes were identified based on these 41 significant SNPs. One candidate gene, GsCID1 (Glysoja.04g010563), harbored two significant SNPs—AX-93713187, with a non-synonymous mutation, and AX-93713188, with a synonymous mutation. GsCID1 was highly expressed during seed development based on public information resources. The polymorphisms in this gene were associated with SW. We developed a derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) marker for GsCID1 that was highly associated with SW and was validated as a functional marker. In summary, the revealed SNPs/genes are useful for understanding the genetic architecture of yield-related traits in wild soybean, which could be used as a potential exotic resource to improve cultivated soybean yields."

      abstract: "Plant breeders continually generate ever-higher yielding cultivars, but also want to improve seed constituent value, which is mainly protein and oil, in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Identification of genetic loci governing those two traits would facilitate that effort. Though genome-wide association offers one such approach, selective genotyping of multiple biparental populations offers a complementary alternative, and was evaluated here, using 48 F2:3 populations (n = ∼224 plants) created by mating 48 high protein germplasm accessions to cultivars of similar maturity, but with normal seed protein content. All F2:3 progeny were phenotyped for seed protein and oil, but only 22 high and 22 low extreme progeny in each F2:3 phenotypic distribution were genotyped with a 1536-SNP chip (ca 450 bimorphic SNPs detected per mating). A significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) on one or more chromosomes was detected for protein in 35 (73%), and for oil in 25 (52%), of the 48 matings, and these QTL exhibited additive effects of ≥ 4 g kg(-1) and R(2) values of 0.07 or more. These results demonstrated that a multiple-population selective genotyping strategy, when focused on matings between parental phenotype extremes, can be used successfully to identify germplasm accessions possessing large-effect QTL alleles. Such accessions would be of interest to breeders to serve as parental donors of those alleles in cultivar development programs, though 17 of the 48 accessions were not unique in terms of SNP genotype, indicating that diversity among high protein accessions in the germplasm collection is less than what might ordinarily be assumed."

Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was used to produce nucleotide resolution methylomes for soybean and common bean. We found that, in soybean, CG body-methylated genes were abundant in WGD genes, which were, on average, more highly expressed than single-copy genes and had slower evolutionary rates than unmethylated genes, suggesting that WGD genes evolve more slowly than single-copy genes. CG body-methylated genes were also enriched in shared single-copy genes (single copy in both species) that may be responsible for the broad and high expression patterns of this class of genes. In addition, diverged methylation patterns in non-CG contexts between paralogs were due mostly to TEs in or near genes, suggesting a role for TEs and non-CG methylation in regulating gene expression post polyploidy. Reference methylomes for both soybean and common bean were constructed, providing resources for investigating epigenetic variation in legume crops. Also, the analysis of methylation patterns of duplicated and single-copy genes has provided insights into the functional consequences of polyploidy and epigenetic regulation in plant genomes."

      abstract: Polyploidy and life-strategy transitions between annuality and
        perenniality often occur in flowering plants. However, the evolutionary
        propensities of polyploids and the genetic bases of such transitions
        remain elusive. We assembled chromosome-level genomes of representative
        perennial species across the genus Glycine including five diploids and a
        young allopolyploid, and constructed a Glycine super-pangenome framework
        by integrating 26 annual soybean genomes. These perennial diploids
        exhibit greater genome stability and possess fewer centromere repeats
        than the annuals. Biased subgenomic fractionation occurred in the
        allopolyploid, primarily by accumulation of small deletions in gene
        clusters through illegitimate recombination, which was associated with
        pre-existing local subgenomic differentiation. Two genes annotated to
        modulate vegetative-reproductive phase transition and lateral shoot
        outgrowth were postulated as candidates underlying the
        perenniality-annuality transition. Our study provides insights into
        polyploid genome evolution and lays a foundation for unleashing genetic
        potential from the perennial gene pool for soybean improvement.

      abstract: "Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) is an important crop in the world. In this study, a Chinese local soybean cultivar, Hedou 12, was re-sequenced by next generation sequencing technology to develop INsertion/DELetion (INDEL) markers for genetic mapping. 49,276 INDEL polymorphisms and 242,059 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were detected between Hedou 12 and the Williams 82 reference sequence. Of these, 243 candidate INDEL .markers ranging from 5 to 50 bp in length were chosen for PCR validation, and 165 (68%) of them revealed polymorphisms between Hedou 12 and Williams 82. The validated INDEL markers were also tested in 12 other soybean .cultivars. The number of polymorphisms in the pairwise comparisons of 14 soybean cultivars varied from 27 to 165. To test the utility of these INDEL markers, they were used to perform a genetic mapping of a crinkly leaf mutant, and the CRINKLY LEAF locus was successfully mapped to a 360 Kb region on chromosome 7. This research shows that high-throughput sequencing technologies can facilitate the development of genome-wide molecular markers for genetic mapping in soybean."

      abstract: "Studies on structural variation in plants have revealed the inadequacy of a single reference genome for an entire species and suggest that it is necessary to build a species-representative genome called a pan-genome to better capture the extent of both structural and nucleotide variation. Here, we present a pan-genome of cultivated soybean (Glycine max), termed PanSoy, constructed using the de novo genome assembly of 204 phylogenetically and geographically representative improved accessions selected from the larger GmHapMap collection. PanSoy uncovers 108 Mb (˜11%) of novel nonreference sequences encompassing 3621 protein-coding genes (including 1659 novel genes) absent from the soybean 'Williams 82' reference genome. Nonetheless, the core genome represents an exceptionally large proportion of the genome, with >90.6% of genes being shared by >99% of the accessions. A majority of PAVs encompassing genes could be confirmed with long-read sequencing on a subset of accessions. The PanSoy is a major step towards capturing the extent of genetic variation in cultivated soybean and provides a resource for soybean genomics research and breeding."

      abstract: "Soybean is an important oil-producing crop in the Fabaceae family and there are increasing demands for soybean oil and other soybean products. Genetic improvement of soybean is needed to increase its production. In order to provide genetic diversity and resources for identifying important genes, a new ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenized soybean population was generated using the newly released germplasm, JTN-5203 (maturity group V). Treatment of soybean seeds with 60 mM EMS concentration was found to be suitable for inducing mutation. A total of 1,820 M1 individuals were produced from 15,000 treated seeds. The resulting M2 population was planted in the field for phenotyping. After harvest, seed traits including total oil, protein, starch, moisture content, fatty acid and amino acid compositions were measured by NIR. Phenotypic variations observed in this population include changes in leaf morphology, plant architecture, seed compositions, and yield. Of most interest, we identified plants with increased amounts of total protein (50% vs. 41% for control) and plants with higher amounts of total oil (25% vs. 21.2% control). Similarly, we identified plants with increases in oleic acid content and decreases in linoleic acid and linolenic acid. This EMS mutant population will be used for further studies including screening for various traits such as amino acid pathways, allergens, phytic acids, and other important soybean agronomic traits. In addition, these mutant individuals will be evaluated in the next generation to assess the heritability. Beneficial traits from these mutants can be exploited for future soybean breeding programs. This germplasm can also be used for discovering novel mutant alleles and for functional gene expression analysis using reverse genetics tools such as TILLING."

SNP data were derived from these 79 lines along with the 41 parents of the SoyNAM project (data provided by Dr. Perry Cregan (USDA-ARS) and the Soybean NAM project). For this project twenty seeds from each line were acquired from USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection and planted in the USDA greenhouse at Iowa State University. Once plants reached the trifoliolate stage, leaves from up to 10 plants were pooled and genomic DNA was extracted. DNA was sent to Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology for next-generation sequencing. In addition, replicated field trials were conducted on a subset of lines (30 of the 79 lines, plus ancestral varieties that were not sequenced) to measure protein, oil, yield, and other characteristics under standard growth conditions, to dissociate the effect of on-farm improvements from genetic gain. Additional details for each of the data types are available in the Methodology tab in the respective visualization tools."

      doi: "10.1186/s12870-014-0408-y"
      abstract: "Background: Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) is the most important soybean disease in Eastern Canada. The development of resistant cultivars represents the most cost-effective means of limiting the impact of this disease. In view of ensuring durable resistance, it is imperative to identify germplasm harbouring different resistance loci and to provide breeders with closely linked molecular markers to facilitate breeding. With this end in view, we assessed resistance using a highly reproducible artificial inoculation method on a diverse collection of 101 soybean lines, mostly composed of plant introductions (PIs) and some of which had previously been reported to be resistant to sclerotinia stem rot. Results: Overall, 50% of the lines exhibited a level of resistance equal to or better than the resistant checks among elite material. Of the 50 lines previously reported to be resistant, only 20 were in this category and a few were highly susceptible under these inoculation conditions. The collection of lines was genetically characterized using a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) protocol that we have optimized for soybean. A total of 8,397 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained and used to perform an association analysis for SSR by using a mixed linear model as implemented in the TASSEL software. Three genomic regions were found to exhibit a significant association at a stringent threshold (q=0.10) and all of the most highly resistant PIs shared the same alleles at these three QTLs. The strongest association was found on chromosome Gm03 (P-value=2.03 x 10-6). The other significantly associated markers were found on chromosomes Gm08 and Gm20 with P-values <10-5. Conclusion: This work will facilitate breeding efforts for increased resistance to Sclerotinia stem rot through the use of these PIs."

    accession PI 483463
  description: High-quality genome assemblies for soybean (Glycine max) and wild
    soybean (Glycine soja). These provide complements to the primary reference
    assembly for Glycine max cv. Williams 82 (Wm82.a2). The G. max assembly is
    for cultivar Lee, which has been used a parent in many southern U.S.
    breeding projects. The G. soja assembly is for accession PI 483463. This
    line was chosen for its high genotypic dissimilarity with respect to
    cultivated soybean. It originates from Shanxi Province, in north-central
    China.

      abstract: "We report reference-quality genome assemblies and annotations for two
        accessions of soybean (Glycine max) and for one accession of Glycine
        soja, the closest wild relative of G. max. The G. max assemblies
        provided are for widely used US cultivars: the northern line Williams 82
        (Wm82) and the southern line Lee. The Wm82 assembly improves the prior
        published assembly, and the Lee and G. soja assemblies are new for these
        accessions. Comparisons among the three accessions show generally high
        structural conservation, but nucleotide difference of 1.7
        single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) per kb between Wm82 and Lee, and
        4.7 snps per kb between these lines and G. soja. snp distributions and
        comparisons with genotypes of the Lee and Wm82 parents highlight
        patterns of introgression and haplotype structure. Comparisons against
        the US germplasm collection show placement of the sequenced accessions
        relative to global soybean diversity. Analysis of a pan-gene collection
        shows generally high conservation, with variation occurring primarily in
        genomically clustered gene families. We found approximately 40-42
        inversions per chromosome between either Lee or Wm82v4 and G. soja, and
        approximately 32 inversions per chromosome between Wm82 and Lee. We also
        investigated five domestication loci. For each locus, we found two
        different alleles with functional differences between G. soja and the
        two domesticated accessions. The genome assemblies for multiple
        cultivated accessions and for the closest wild ancestor of soybean
        provides a valuable set of resources for identifying causal variants
        that underlie traits for the domestication and improvement of soybean,
        serving as a basis for future research and crop improvement efforts for
        this important crop species."

  description: "The objectives of this study were to determine the abundance of SSRs in the soybean genome and to develop and test soybean SSR markers to create a database of locus-specific markers with a high likelihood of polymorphism. A total of 210,990 SSRs with di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats of five or more were identified in the soybean whole genome sequence (WGS) which included 61,458 SSRs consisting of repeat units of di- (≥10), tri- (≥8), and tetranucleotide (≥7). Among the 61,458 SSRs, (AT)n, (ATT)n and (AAAT)n were the most abundant motifs among di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide SSRs, respectively. After screening for a number of factors including locus-specificity using e-PCR, a soybean SSR database (BARCSOYSSR_1.0) with the genome position and primer sequences for 33,065 SSRs was created."

To examine the likelihood that primers in the database would function to amplify locus-specific polymorphic products, 1034 primer sets were evaluated by amplifying DNAs of seven diverse Glycine max (L.) Merr. and one wild soybean (Glycine soja Siebold & Zucc.) genotypes. A total of 978 (94.6%) of the primer sets amplified a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product and 798 (77.2%) amplified polymorphic amplicons as determined by 4.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The BARCSOYSSR1.0 SSR markers can be found in Soy- Base (http://soybase.org; verified 21 June 2010) the USDA-ARS Soybean Genome Database."
