  commonName: lima bean
  description: The lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), initially from South and Central
    America, is an herbaceous plant that is a part of the legume family (Fabaceae).
    It is commonly known as the lima bean, butter bean, sieva bean, double bean or
    Madagascar bean, is a legume grown for its edible seeds or beans. The two gene
    pools, meso and south American, of cultivated lima beans is believed to point
    to independent domestication events. The Mesoamerican lima bean is distributed
    in neotropical lowlands while the other is found in the western Andes.
  genus: Phaseolus
  species: lunatus
  strains:
  - description: G27455 was selected from MI population, which is the most widespread
      among domesticated gene pools. Domesticated accessions have low heterozygosity,
      which reduces the complexity of genome assembly. G27455 is cultivated in the
      north of Colombia, where temperatures are very high all year, suggesting it
      may be a good source of candidate genes for resistance to heat and drought stress.

  commonName: common bean
  description: Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was likely domesticated independently
    both in Central America and in the Andes, from distinct wild gene pools that exist
    in the two regions. Beans were also carried into North America and were grown
    by Native Americans there for many centuries. They were carried to Europe by early
    explorers of the New World, and have undergone about 500 years of additional domestication
    and selection in Europe. The species has great agricultural variety, and is of
    critical importance as a high-protein food across the world.

  - description: Andean landrace G19833 was selected for genome sequencing partly
      due to its resistance to numerous diseases, including bean rust (Uromyces appendiculatus),
      as well as anthracnose, angular leaf spot, Aschochyta blight, and the bean golden
      mosaic and bean common mosaic viruses (Hurtado-Gonzales et al., 2017; https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdaarsfacpub/1664/).
      This accession has also been used to generate populations for mapping traits
      such as phosphorous acquisition and agronomic performance.
