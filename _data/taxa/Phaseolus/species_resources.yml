  commonName: lima bean
  description: The lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), initially from South and Central
    America, is an herbaceous plant that is a part of the legume family (Fabaceae).
    It is commonly known as the lima bean, butter bean, sieva bean, double bean or
    Madagascar bean, is a legume grown for its edible seeds or beans. The two gene
    pools, meso and south American, of cultivated lima beans is believed to point
    to independent domestication events. The Mesoamerican lima bean is distributed
    in neotropical lowlands while the other is found in the western Andes.

  - accession: G27455
    description: G27455 was selected from MI population, which is the most widespread
      among domesticated gene pools. Domesticated accessions have low heterozygosity,
      which reduces the complexity of genome assembly. G27455 is cultivated in the
      north of Colombia, where temperatures are very high all year, suggesting it
      may be a good source of candidate genes for resistance to heat and drought stress.

  commonName: common bean
  description: Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was likely domesticated independently
    both in Central America and in the Andes, from distinct wild gene pools that exist
    in the two regions. Beans were also carried into North America and were grown
    by Native Americans there for many centuries. They were carried to Europe by early
    explorers of the New World, and have undergone about 500 years of additional domestication
    and selection in Europe. The species has great agricultural variety, and is of
    critical importance as a high-protein food across the world.

    description: Common bean genotype BAT 93, a representative of the Mesoamerican
      gene pool, was bred for high productivity in tropical conditions at the Centro
      Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT), Colombia (Voysest, 1983, 2000).
      It was selected from a double cross population developed between landraces.
      BAT 93 was selected for mutagenesis (Table 1) because it is one of the parents
      of the core common bean mapping population (Freyre et al., 1998), it has been
      used in the generation of a large BAC library (Kami et al., 2006), and it is
      amenable for production in temperate and tropical environments and under growth
      chamber, greenhouse, or field conditions (Blair et al., 2005). BAT 93 also possesses
      several desirable characteristics (Table 1), including disease resistance (Sanchez-Valdez
      et al., 2004). Seed of BAT 93 were carefully generated for the experiment from
      single plant selections and confirmed for homogeneity using simple sequence
      repeat marker analysis at CIAT.
