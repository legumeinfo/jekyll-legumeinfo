description: 'Phaseolus (bean, wild bean) is a genus of herbaceous to woody annual
  and perennial vines in the family Fabaceae containing about 70 plant species, all
  native to the Americas, primarily Mesoamerica. It is one of the most economically
  important legume genera. Five of the species have been domesticated since pre-Columbian
  times for their beans: P. acutifolius (tepary bean), P. coccineus (runner bean),
  P. dumosus (year bean), P. lunatus (lima bean), and P. vulgaris (common bean). Most
  prominent among these is the common bean, P. vulgaris, which today is cultivated
  worldwide in tropical, semitropical, and temperate climates.'
