  description: 'Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is a legume species in the group of ''cool-season''
    legumes, along with lentil, pea, faba bean and clovers. Chickpea is one of the
    earliest cultivated legumes: 7,500-year-old remains have been found in the Middle
    East. Other common names for the species include garbanzo bean, ceci bean, sanagalu,
    chana and Bengal gram. There to are two main types of cultivated chickpeas based
    on seed morphology, desi and kabuli. The desi type of chickpea consists of seeds
    with a yellow interior but have a thick, wrinkled and dark seed coat, the seeds
    are approximately 6 to 7 mm in size. The majority of desi chickpeas are split
    in half to make Chana Dahl. Whereas, the kabuli type of chickpea are lighter in
    color, have a smooth seed coat and about 8 to 9 mm in size. The kabuli type of
    chickpeas are the most common type found in America.'
