  description: 'Lotus japonicus, a forage crop (much like clover), is widely used
    as a model in legume biology. It is physically small in stature, with a small
    genome, and a short generation time, and it is relatively easily transformable
    (for gene functional studies). Genome version available on LIS is version Lj2.5
    and Lj3.0, publication associated with this genome version is available here:
    Sato et al., 2008 (doi:10.1093/dnares/dsn008).'

    description: 'Lotus japonicus ecotype Miyakojima (MG-20) was identified as an
      early-flowering accession, with traits that distinguish it from other Japanese
      accessions: low concentrations of anthocyanin in the stem and petals, few trichomes,
      a more upright habit, broad leaflets and petals, and large black seeds (Pajuelo
      and Stougaard, 2005, in: A.J. Marquez (ed.), Lotus japonicus Hadbook, pp. 3-24).'
