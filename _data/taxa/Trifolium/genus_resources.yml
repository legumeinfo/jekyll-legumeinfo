commonName: Trifolium L., 1753
description: 'Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus Trifolium
  (Latin, tres ''three'' + folium ''leaf''), consisting of about 300 species of flowering
  plants in the legume or pea family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has
  a cosmopolitan distribution with highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere,
  but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes
  on mountains in the tropics. They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial
  herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm tall. The leaves are trifoliate
  (rarely quatrefoiled; see four-leaf clover), monofoil, bifoil, cinquefoil, hexafoil,
  septfoil, etcetera, with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes
  of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed
  in the calyx.[3] Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus
  (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover). '
