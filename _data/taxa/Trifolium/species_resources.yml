  description: Red clover (Trifolium pratense) is a perennial legume species native
    to Northwest Africa, Europe and Western Asia. Today, red clover is found in many
    regions around the world including the Americas and Australia. Unlike other legume
    species, red clover is an outcrossing species due to a strong gametophytic incompatibility
    system. Red clover is a widely grown fodder legume crop and is valued for its
    role in increasing soil fertility by nitrogen fixation.
