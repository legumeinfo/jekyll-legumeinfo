  description: Red clover (Trifolium pratense) is a perennial legume species native
    to Northwest Africa, Europe and Western Asia. Today, red clover is found in many
    regions around the world including the Americas and Australia. Unlike other legume
    species, red clover is an outcrossing species due to a strong gametophytic incompatibility
    system. Red clover is a widely grown fodder legume crop and is valued for its
    role in increasing soil fertility by nitrogen fixation.

  commonName: Subterranean clover
  description: Trifolium subterraneum, the subterranean clover, is a species of clover
    native to Europe, Southwest Asia, Northwest Africa and Macaronesia. The plant's
    name comes from its underground seed development (geocarpy), a characteristic
    not possessed by other clovers. It can thrive in poor-quality soil where other
    clovers cannot survive, and is grown commercially for animal fodder. There are
    three distinct subspecies used in agriculture, each with its own ideal climate
    and soil type, allowing for wide distribution of the plant over varied environments.

    description: SequenceServer BLAST against Trifolium subterraneum Daliak v2
    name: LIS SequenceServer
  species: subterraneum
  strains:
  - accession: Daliak
    description: Daliak is a semi-erect, plain-leafed variety that produces well,
      and seeds prolifically throughout the sub clover belt of Australia. Due to its
      mid-season maturity it is more productive than the early-maturing Northam, Nungarin
      or Dalkeith, but less productive than later maturing varieties. Daliak is resistant
      to the eastern Australian strain of clover scorch and is tolerant of the sub
      clover root disease complex, but it is more susceptible than other varieties
      to attack by bluegreen aphid.
