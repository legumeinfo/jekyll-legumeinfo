species:
- abbrev: lupal
  commonName: White lupin
  description: White lupin (Lupinus albus) has been used as a model to study the development
    of dense root hairs, for phosphorous uptake, in phosphorous-deficient soils. See
    O'Rourke et al., 2013 (DOI:10.1104/pp.112.209254).
  genus: Lupinus
  species: albus
  strains:
  - accession: LAGI01
    description: Lupinus albus strain LAGI01 was used in a study of response to low-phosphorous
      stress, in O'Rourke et al., 2013 (DOI:10.1104/pp.112.209254). The strain identifier
      'LAGI01' is informal, being an abbreviation of 'Lupinus albus Gene Index', and
      does not uniquely identify a particular accession.
