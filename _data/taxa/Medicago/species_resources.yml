  description: Alfalfa, also called lucerne and called Medicago sativa in binomial
    nomenclature, is a perennial flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It
    is cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world.
    It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop.
    The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly
    used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.
