  description: Medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa (M. sativa), is widely
    used as a model in legume biology. It is physically small in stature, with a small
    genome, and has a short generation-to-generation time. Sevweral high-quality genome
    assemblies have been generated, including Tang et al., 2014 (DOI:10.1186/1471-2164-15-312)
    and Pecrix et al., 2018 (DOI:10.1038/s41477-018-0286-7).

  strains:
  - accession: A17_HM341
    description: 'Medicago truncatula accession A17_HM341 has been used for a large
      number of genetic and genomic studies. The genome for this accession has been
      used as the basis for several high-quality genome assemblies: including Tang
      et al., 2014 (DOI:10.1186/1471-2164-15-312) and Pecrix et al., 2018 (DOI:10.1038/s41477-018-0286-7).'

  - accession: R108_HM340
    description: 'Medicago truncatula strain R108 has been used in various genetic
      and genomic studies, e.g. Gaige et al., 2011 (DOI:10.1080/07060661.2012.662176),
      Li et al., 2014 (DOI:10.1016/j.jplph.2013.12.018), and Cosson et al., 2006 (DOI:10.1385/1-59745-130-4:115).
