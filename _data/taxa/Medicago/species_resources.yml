  description: Alfalfa, also called lucerne and called Medicago sativa in binomial
    nomenclature, is a perennial flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It
    is cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world.
    It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop.
    The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly
    used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

  - accession: RegenSY27x
    description: This plant was selected for high regeneration in tissue culture.
      It was bred by crossing two plants, first generation selfed (S1) parents from
      Regen-S (Medicago sativa) and Regen-Y (Medicago falcata) (Bingham, ET. 1991.
      Registration of alfalfa hybrid Regen-SY germplasm for tissue culture and transformation
      research. Crop Science 31:1098.) It has purple flowers but clusters more closely
      with M. falcata than with M. sativa.

  description: Medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa (M. sativa), is widely
    used as a model in legume biology. It is physically small in stature, with a small
    genome, and has a short generation-to-generation time. Sevweral high-quality genome
    assemblies have been generated, including Tang et al., 2014 (DOI:10.1186/1471-2164-15-312)
    and Pecrix et al., 2018 (DOI:10.1038/s41477-018-0286-7).
