commonName: Medick, Burclover
description: "Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or\
  \ burclover, in the legume family (Fabaceae). It contains at least 87 species and\
  \ is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean basin. The best-known member of\
  \ the genus is alfalfa (M. sativa), an important forage crop, and the genus name\
  \ is based on the Latin name for that plant, medica, from Greek: \u03BC\u03B7\u03B4\
  \u03B9\u03BA\u03AE (\u03C0\u03CC\u03B1) Median (grass). Most members of the genus\
  \ are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name).\
  \ However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (M. arborea) is\
  \ a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as\
  \ medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome\
  \ numbers in Medicago range from 2n = 14 to 48. The species Medicago truncatula\
  \ is a model legume due to its relatively small stature, small genome (450\u2013\
  500 Mbp), short generation time (about 3 months), and ability to reproduce both\
  \ by outcrossing and selfing."
