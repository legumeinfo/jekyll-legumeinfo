  description: Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) was domesticated at the foot of the South
    American Andes within modern-day Argentina, Bolivia, or Paraguay. Cultivated peanuts
    are allotetraploids, with sub-genomes probably contributed by the hybridization
    of the diploid species Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaensis.

  commonName: diploid wild peanut - A-genome
  description: 'Arachis duranensis, a wild herb native to Argentina, Bolivia, and
    Paraguay, is thought to be one of the diploid ancestors of cultivated peanut.
    Its genome has been sequenced as part of the Peanut Genomics Initiative, to help
    in the accurate assembly of the more important cultivated peanut, A. hypogaea.
    Cultivated peanut derived all of its genetic material from two wild ancestors,
    A. duranensis and A. ipaensis whose genomes merged several thousand years ago,
    in a rare genetic event. The wild species, therefore, have half as much genetic
    material as cultivated peanut. These two simpler genomes have first been sequenced
    toward achieving its ultimate goal: the complete genomic sequence for cultivated
    peanut. The cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid (2n=4x=40) that carries both
    the A and B genomes and A. duranensis (2n=2x=20) has likely contributed the A
    genome, the smaller set of chromosomes in the karyotype. These two ancestral diploids
    separated from each other about 3 million years ago. The genome merger, allopolyploidy
    event, ocurred relatively very recently, five to ten thousand years ago, followed
    by domestication in South America from where it appeared in most part of the world
    by 1600. Arachis duranensis is described further in Bertioli et al., 2016 (doi:10.1038/ng.3517)'

  description: 'Arachis ipaensis A. ipaensis, native to Bolivia, is thought to be

    just been sequenced as part of the Peanut Genomics Initiative, to help in the

    derived all of its genetic material from two wild ancestors, A. duranensis and

  description: Arachis cardenasii Krapov. & W.C. Greg. is a wild peanut relative native
    to Bolivia. It has been used by peanut breeders and geneticists in interspecific
    hybrids with cultivated peanut (A. hypogaea) as a source of pest and disease resistance.
    A. cardenasii is a diploid  species in the 'A-genome' group of Arachis, similar
    to A. duranensis, which contributed one of the two subgenomes to tetraploid cultivated
    peanut.
