  commonName: adzuki bean
  description: Adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) is a diploid legume crop (2n = 2x = 22).
    Adzuki beans are commonly sweetened before eating by boiling the beans with sugar,
    resulting in red bean paste. The adzuki bean is a good dietary source for a variety
    of minerals including; magnesium, potassium and zinc. Genome assemblies have been
    generated for several accessions.

  commonName: mungbean
  description: Mungbean (Vigna radiata), also known as moong bean, green gram, is
    a fast-growing warm-season legume and has a diploid chromosome number of 2n=22.
    Mungbean is mainly cultivated today in China, India and Southeast Asia but can
    be found in dry regions within Southern Europe and United States. Mungbeans are
    a good source of dietary protein, folate and iron. This legume species was moved
    from the genus Phaseolus to Vigna and is correctly cites as Vigna radiata.

    description: Vigna radiata accession VC1973A was chosen for genome sequencing.
      VC1973A was developed at the AVRDC-The World Vegetable Center in 1982; since
      then, it has been widely grown in Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Canada and China
      as a heteronymous cultivar called 'Seonhwanogdu' in Korea, 'Kamphaeng Saen 1'
      in Thailand and 'Zhong Lu' in China. Accession description is from Kang et al.,

  commonName: cowpea
  description: Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is used in many parts of the world for its
    high-protein seeds, but also for its nutrient-rich edible leaves, forage, and
    soil enrichment. Cowpea is generally more heat-tolerant than common bean. Cowpeas
    are one of the most important food legume crops in the semi-arid tropics that
    cover Asia, Africa, southern Europe and Central and South America. A drought-tolerant
    and warm-weather crop, cowpeas are well-adapted to the drier regions of the tropics,
    where other food legumes do not perform as well. It also has the useful ability
    to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, and it grows well in poor
    soils.

  - accession: CB5-2
    description: CB5-2 is a fully inbred stock that is closely related to CB5, which
      was the predominant Blackeye of the US Southwest for several decades. CB5 (Blackeye

      add resistances to Fusarium wilt and nematodes to a previously preferred California
      Blackeye landrace.
