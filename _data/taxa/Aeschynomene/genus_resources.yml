description: Aeschynomene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, and
  was recently assigned to the informal monophyletic Dalbergia clade of the Dalbergieae.
  They are known commonly as jointvetches. These legumes are most common in warm regions
  and many species are aquatic. The genus as currently circumscribed is paraphyletic
  and it has been suggested that the subgenus Ochopodium be elevated to a new genus
  within the Dalbergieae, though other changes will also be required to render the
  genus monophyletic.
