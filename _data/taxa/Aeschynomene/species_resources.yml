  description: The legume genus Aeschynomene L. includes approximately 150 tropical
    and subtropical species, part of them having a semi-aquatic lifestyle. Some hydrophytic
    Aeschynomene species display unusual symbiotic features such as stem nodulation
    and the presence of a Nod factor-independent infection process with some Bradyrhizobium
    strains. To decipher the mechanisms of this original symbiotic process, Aeschynomene
    evenia has emerged as a new model legume because of its advantageous genetic and
    developmental characteristics for molecular genetics. A. evenia (2n=20, 400 Mb/1C)
    is an autogamous diploid species that is annual or short-lived perennial, consisting
    of various genotypes.

  - accession: CIAT22838
    description: The sequenced A. evenia genotype is an inbred line produced by IRD
      from the accession CIAT22838 originating from Malawi. 94% of the 400 Mb genome
      was assembled, 80% anchored to the 10 A. evenia chromosomes and 32,667 protein-coding
      genes predicted, providing a platform for comparative genomics and analysis
      of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis in legumes.
