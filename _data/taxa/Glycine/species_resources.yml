  commonName: soybean
  description: 'Soybean (Glycine max), the predominant oil-seed legume worldwide,
    was likely domesticated in East Asia, ~6000-9000 years ago (Sedivy et al., 2017;
    https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14418). It has many culinary and industrial uses.
    Some of the culinary uses include: for direct consumption of the green seed (i.e.
    edamame) and leaves (cooked, much like spinach); for tofu, soymilk, textured vegetable
    protein, soy sauce, tempeh, natto, and vegetable oil. Industrial uses include:
    oils, soap, cosmetics, and biodiesel. Soybean is also used as a high-protein forage,
    and can be prepared for fish- and animal-feed.'

    Populations of G. soja exist in the wild in China, Japan, Korea, and Russia. Analysis

    approximately 200 thousand years ago. The species remain interfertile, and G.
    soja accessions are used in breeding projects in order to introgress traits such
    as tolerance to particular diseases or environmental stresses.

    G. dolichocarpa is an allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 80) formed by hybridizatoin between
    G. syndetika and G. tomentella D3 (both 2n = 40). (This species was formerly part
    of the Glycine tomentella species complex and was referred to as G. tomentella
    T2.) It has a limited Australian range in Queensland, but like several other Glycine
    allopolyploids, has colonized islands of the Pacific Ocean (in this case Taiwan)
    where no perennial diploid Glycine species have been found ( Ratnaparkhe et al

    in that it does not form a vine but rather short, erect stems from a fibrous woody
    root system instead of the more common taproot. Seeds are round and smooth similar
    to the annual species. G. falcata is a diploid (2n = 40) and is the sole member
    of the F-genome. It is sister to the remainder of subgenus Glycine, and is distinctive
    ecologically, characteristically growing in the black soil region of Queensland
    and possessing both chasmogamous and below- ground cleistogamous flowers, the
    latter producing geocarpic fruits (Ratnaparkhe et al 2011; Gonzalez-Orozco et
    al., 2012).

  description: Glycine stenophita (B.E. Pfeil & Tind.) is a scrambling or climbing
    perennial that is glabrous or with sparse white hairs covering the stems. Pods
    are 4 to 6 seeded and seeds are generally barrel shaped with some variation in
    shape from elliptical to square. G. stenophita is a diploid (2n = 40) member of
    the B-genome group. It occurs in the Australian states of Queensland and New South
    Wales (Ratnaparkhe et al 2011; Gonzalez-Orozco et al., 2012).

  description: Glycine syndetika (B.E. Pfeil & Craven) is a twining perennial plant
    with three leathery, often persistent leaflets. Flowers are somewhat clustered
    towards to the top of the inflorescences and pods contain 4-9 relatively large
    square seeds (Pfeil. BE et al., 2006). G. syndetika is diploid (2n = 40) member
    of the A-genome clade. (This species was formerly part of the Glycine tomentella
    species complex and was referred to as G. tomentella D4. ) It is has a restricted
    range in the Eastern Queensland region of Australia (Ratnaparkhe et al 2011; Gonzalez-Orozco
    et al., 2012).
