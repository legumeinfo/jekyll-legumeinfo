  title: "Improving Biotic and Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Soybean Using Existing Genetic Diversity and Genome Editing"
  short_title: "Improving Biotic and Abiotic Stress Tolerance"
  description: "This project focuses on genetic mechanisms to address biotic and abiotic stresses, with the goal of developing cultivars with robust responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, by identifying useful alleles from across a broad germplasm collection. The project wil also evaluate the feasibility of engineering the effector-triggered immunity for enhancing disease resistance against four serious soybean pathogens through gene editing."

  title: "Development and Phenotypic Screening of an Ethyl Methane Sulfonate Mutant Population in Soybean"
  short_title: "Soybean EMS Mutagenized Population"
  description: "In order to provide genetic diversity and resources for identifying important genes, a new ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenized soybean population was generated using the newly released germplasm, JTN-5203 (maturity group V). After harvest of a muagenized population, seed traits were evaluated including total oil, protein, starch, moisture content, fatty acid and amino acid compositions. Phenotypic variations observed in this population include changes in leaf morphology, plant architecture, seed compositions, and yield. We identified plants with increased amounts of total protein (50% vs. 41% for control) and plants with higher amounts of total oil (25% vs. 21.2% control). We also identified plants with increases in oleic acid content and decreases in linoleic acid and linolenic acid. This EMS mutant population will be used for further studies including screening for various traits such as amino acid pathways, allergens, phytic acids, and other important soybean agronomic traits."

  title: "Single-base resolution DNA methylomes of two legume species, Glycine max (soybean) and Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean)"
  short_title: "DNA Methylomes of Two Legume Species"
  description: "Soybean (Glycine max) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) share a paleopolyploidy (whole-genome duplication [WGD]) event, approximately 56.5 million years ago, followed by a genus Glycine-specific polyploidy, approximately 10 million years ago. Cytosine methylation is an epigenetic mark that plays an important role in the regulation of genes and transposable elements (TEs); however, the role of DNA methylation in the fate/evolution of genes following polyploidy and speciation has not been fully explored. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was used to produce nucleotide resolution methylomes for soybean and common bean. Reference methylomes for both soybean and common bean were constructed, providing resources for investigating epigenetic variation in legume crops. Also, the analysis of methylation patterns of duplicated and single-copy genes has provided insights into the functional consequences of polyploidy and epigenetic regulation in plant genomes."
