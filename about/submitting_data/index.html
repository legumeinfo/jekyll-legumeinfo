<h2>Submitting Data to LIS</h2>

LIS is a community resource dedicated to making research results broadly available as soon after publication as possible. Researchers can help us meet this objective by submitting their data directly. Our curators can also help to clean up and properly present data at LIS prior to publication. It will be helpful if you contact us before submitting your data so that we can help you through the process.

We have transitioned (in late 2020) to using a set of simple file formats in the LIS/Legume Federation Data Store to store data for GWAS, QTL, maps, markers, etc. These data sets can be prepared using the following templates:

GWAS template(link is external)
QTL template(link is external) (including map and marker worksheets)
Please contact us if you have a different type of data you would like LIS to host and we will work with you to make that happen.
