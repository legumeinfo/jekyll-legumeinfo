<h3>Citing SoyBase</h3>

<p>
  We use references to SoyBase in the literature as one way to demonstrate the utility of SoyBase to the research community. Simply placing only a link within the paper (e.g., https://www.soybase.org) is not sufficient, as we cannot easily track these sorts of references. Instead, please include one of the references below, and also include 'SoyBase' at least once in your paper as well as the URL, e.g. ....SoyBase (https://legacy.soybase.org)....
