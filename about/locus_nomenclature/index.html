<h2>Molecular Locus Nomenclature</h2>

<p>
  A major problem with many of the current naming conventions is that they often contain both locus and allele information in the names, are based on a particular technology and/or contain bold, italic, super/subscripts or some other characters or formatting that are incompatible with electronic databases. 
</p>

<p>
  <b>For example:</b><br>
* E(CCA)M(AGC)114 or ACAAAC110 : AFLP locus, name gives discriminatory bases and band size<br>
* OH03_700: RAPD locus with band size given<br>
* U379_500T: RAPD locus with band size, reason for T not known This is obviously not ideal as the same locus in a different variety might well have a different band size.<br>
</p>

<p>
There are at least two kinds of names needed:<br>
* physical clones <br>
* genetic loci and their alleles <br>
There are of course subclasses of these (i.e. sequences of clones), but these cover the major groups. 
</p>

<p>
The Soybean Genetics Committee recommends the following guidelines which will result in names that are compatible with electronic databases. The ones for physical clones are already in use in several labs and seem to be acceptable.
