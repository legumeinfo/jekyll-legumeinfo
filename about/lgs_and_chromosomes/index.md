<h2>Soybean Chromosome Number to Linkage Group Assignments</h2>

<p>
  Soybean chromosome and historical linkage group correspondences.  Linkage group lengths in cM are based on the Soybean Consensus Map 3.0 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893076/">(Choi et al., 2017)</a> produced by Perry Cregan's group at the USDA-ARS Soybean Genomics and Improvement Lab. The 11 initial linkage group to chromosome number assignments were made by Ted Hymowitz's group <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12783169/">(Zou et al., 2003)</a>. The remaining 9 were given chromosome numbers in decreasing order of linkage group genetic length.
