<h2>Soybean Chromosome Number to Linkage Group Assignments</h2>

<p>
  Soybean chromosome and historical linkage group correspondences.  Linkage group lengths in cM are based on the Soybean Consensus Map 3.0 produced by Perry Cregan's group at the USDA-ARS Soybean Genomics and Improvement Lab. The 11 initial linkage group to chromosome number assignments were made by Ted Hymowitz's group [Zou et al. (2003) Assignment of molecular linkage groups to soybean chromosomes by primary trisomics. Theor. Appl. Genet. 107:745-750 and citations therein]. The remaining 9 were given chromosome numbers in decreasing order of linkage group genetic length.
