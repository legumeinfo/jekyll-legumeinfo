<h2>Strain Prefixes, Locations, and Affiliations</h2>

<p> 
Experimental (i.e., unreleased) strains are identified by a number with a state or province code letter prefix. Additional code letters may be used to designate the individuals within a state or province that developed the strain. These codes are a compilation of codes used in the Northern and Southern Uniform Soybean Tests since 1943.
</p>

<p>
Strains originating from Pioneer Hybrid generally begin with the letter "P" followed by 4 digits ie P2345.
Some Pioneer strains have names of the form P followed by two digits followed by one letter followed by two digits ie P49M23.
