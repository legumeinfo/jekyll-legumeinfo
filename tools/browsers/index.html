<h2>Genome browsers</h2>

<p>
  Genome browsers are available for most of the genome assemblies at SoyBase. 
  These can be accessed from the <a href="/resources">GENOMICS</a> tab, with browsers listed under each accession -- or directly from the links below.

<h4><i>Glycine max</i> accessions</h4>

<b>Wm82</b> (Northern United States) <br/>
Williams 82, the soybean cultivar used to produce the reference genome sequence, was derived from backcrossing a phytophthora root rot resistance locus from the donor parent Kingwa into the recurrent parent Williams.

<b>Zh13</b> (China) <br/>
Zhonghuang 13 is a Chinese cultivar derived from accessions Yudou 18 and Zhongzuo 90052-76 by pedigree selection for high yield and stress tolerance (Shen et al., 2018; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-018-9360-0).

<b>Lee</b> (Southern United States) <br/>
Cultivar Lee, which derives from a cross of Chinese lines CNS and S-100, has been widely used as a parent in many breeding projects in the Southern U.S. and in Brazil (Wysmierski and Vello, 2013; http://doi.org/10.1590/S1415-47572013005000041). The variety is notable for resistance to Phytophthora rot, Peanut Mottle Virus, and bacterial pustule (Wysmierski and Vello, 2013).

<h4><i>Glycine soja</i> accessions</h4>

<b>PI483463</b> (Shanxi Province, China) <br/>
Glycine soja accession PI 483463 has been identified as being unusually tolerant (Lee et al., 2009; https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esp027). The genome for this accession has been sequenced, partly on the basis of this salt-tolerance trait.

<b>W05</b> (Henan Province, China) <br/>
Glycine soja accession W05 is a salt-tolerant wild soybean whose genome has been sequenced to serve as a reference genome assembly. The W05 accession has been used for genetic studies of several traits, including indeterminacy, seed size, pod number per plant, and seed color (Xie et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09142-9).
