Several new genomes and annotations have been made available in LIS:
  - reference quality Trifolium pratense and Vicia villosa genomes from the group at USDA Dairy Forage [Cell Wall Biology and Utilization Research](https://www.ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/madison-wi/us-dairy-forage-research-center/cell-wall-biology-and-utilization-research/)
  - haplotype-resolved genomes for Chamaecrista fasciculata and Cercis canadensis from JGI's [Phytozome](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/)

We have also included single-cell experiments from recent publications from the [Libault lab](https://bondlsc.missouri.edu/person/marc-libault/), for [Medicago truncatula](https://shinycell.legumeinfo.org/medtr.A17.gnm5.ann1_6.expr.Cervantes-Perez_Thibivilliers_2022/?gene1=MtRPG) and [Glycine max](https://shinycell.legumeinfo.org/glyma.expr.Cervantes-Perez_Zogli_2024/?gene1=Glyma.18G180800&gene2=Glyma.10G001000&tab=gene-coexpression).

In addition, several bulk RNA-seq experiments have been added, e.g. soybean data from [JGI Plant Gene Atlas](https://plantgeneatlas.jgi.doe.gov/) analyzed against the latest [Wm82.gnm6.ann1 reference](https://mines.legumeinfo.org/legumemine/expressionsource:Wm82.gnm6.ann1.expr.Wm82.Sreedasyam_Plott_2023) and appearing in [gene report pages in LegumeMine](https://mines.legumeinfo.org/legumemine/gene:glyma.Wm82.gnm6.ann1.Glyma.18G180800).
