The LIS team has decommissioned the previous site (formerly housed at https://legacy.legumeinfo.org), as most site components have either been reimplemented or replaced by new functionality. Additional search features will be added in 2023, but rich options for queries, reports, visualization, and analysis exist now via the <a href="https://mines.legumeinfo.org">LIS InterMines</a> and other <a href="{{ "/tools" | relative_url }}">Tools</a> at the site.

Many new datasets have been added to the Data Store and the Mines in the last six months, including genome assemblies and annotation sets:
* <i>Arachis</i> (peanut; 3)
* <i>Cercis</i> (redbud; 1)
* <i>Cicer</i> (chickpea; 2)
* <i>Glycine</i> (soybean; 29)
* <i>Medicago</i> (medics; 4)
* <i>Vigna</i> (mung bean; 1)

There have also been many updates to the <a href="https://mines.legumeinfo.org">Legume InterMines</a>, which now span 10 legume genera.
