We are asking you to participate in a survey about standardized data curation principles and their implementation in data repositories for agricultural research and breeding programs. This survey was developed by the [AgBioData consortium](https://www.agbiodata.org), in which our database is a participant.

The survey is anonymous, and your answers will be used to shape AgBioData's future goals and solutions for standardized data management in agriculture. 

If you are willing to participate, please submit your answers [here](https://ncsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9Zv0sSXJhdz2bYO) by May 16th, 2022. 

Your opinion is valuable to us and can help AgBioData define better genomic, genetic, and breeding data curation practices.
