[Phaseolus acutifolius (tepary bean)](/organism/Phaseolus/acutifolius) is a drought- and heat-tolerant crop
native to the American Southwest and Mexico; it joins the growing set of annotated genomes at LIS,
with a cultivated and wild accession described in [Moghaddam et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22858-x).
The cultivated accession has been added as the primary representative of the species,
and can be found via the standard gene search pages, and genome browsers, while the wild species is accessible via a
Phaseolus data source for the GCV instance located
[here](https://www.legumefederation.org/gcv/legfed_v1_0/search/lis/phavu.Phvul.002G021600;routeParam=1?neighbors=80&matched=15&intermediate=10&algorithm=smith-waterman&match=10&mismatch=-1&gap=-1&score=30&threshold=25&regexp=&order=distance&sources=phaseolus&bintermediate=10&bmask=10&bmatched=15),
which also includes several new accessions of Phaseolus vulgaris (UI111 and LaborOvalle), courtesy of Phytozome.
