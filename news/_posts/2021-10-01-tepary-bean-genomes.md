[Phaseolus acutifolius (tepary bean)](/taxa/phaseolus) is a drought- and heat-tolerant crop
native to the American Southwest and Mexico; it joins the growing set of annotated genomes at LIS,
with a cultivated and wild accession described in [Moghaddam et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22858-x).
The cultivated accession has been added as the primary representative of the species.
