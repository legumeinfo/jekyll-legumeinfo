<h2>About LIS</h2>
<p>The Legume Information System houses genetic and genomic data for legume species, helping to support research and breeding efforts for the many critically important crops in this family.<br> 
  <b>Citing LIS:</b> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/leg3.74">Berendzen et al., 2021</a>
</p>

<h2>Submitting Data</h2>
<p>
  We welcome contributed genetic and genomic data from researchers. Please <a href="mailto:lis@ncgr.org">Contact us</a> if you have any to contribute. Submitting your data will increase its impact, and will provide you and others more ways to explore it. 
</p>

<p>
  Types of data housed at LIS include genome assemblies, gene models and sequences, genetic maps, expression data, QTL and GWAS studies, and variant data. The data will be evaluated by LIS curators and incorporated into standardized formats at the <a href="https://data.legumeinfo.org">Datastore</a> (also represented on the <a href="/collections">COLLECTIONS</a> page). See examples there, and <a href="https://github.com/legumeinfo/datastore-specifications">Datastore specifications here</a> -- but dealing with the curation complexities is our job. We'll be happy to work with you.
