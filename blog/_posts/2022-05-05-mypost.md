This is my blog post. It was written by me. I am its author. There are no other authors. Blog posts have a metadata section as you can see above
containing the layout (blog-item), title, author, date (YYYY-MM-DD), and summary.

You can put HTML in blog posts, but you don't need to use paragraph tags. Line breaks like the one above will render a new paragraph.

## Secondary heading
It's markup, so you can use the secondary heading tag like above. Skip the primary heading since it will be autogenerated.

That's about it! Have fun blogging!
