### Soybean data is changing; so is SoyBase.

The SoyBase team has been working hard on a new database structure and a new modern look. The number of soybean genomes sequenced, analyzed and made available to the public everyday is increasing rapidly. SoyBase is restructuring so that it can handle the influx of data and make it avaialable for the community.
