<h1>LIS - the Legume Information System</h1>

<p>
  LIS integrates genetic and genomic information across many legume species, with tools for research. LIS has been restructured for improved scalability and function. As of April, 2023, the previous incarnation has been decommissioned. Additional functionality will be added through 2023. Please <a href="/about">contact us</a> if you have questions, suggestions, or contributions.
</p>
<p>
  The site is organized as follows. 
  See <a href="/taxa">TAXA</a> to access resources and tools such as browsers, InterMine instances, organized primarily by genus. 
  See <a href="/download">DOWNLOAD</a> to access datasets for download. 
  See <a href="/tools">TOOLS</a> if you have particular tasks in mind.

<h2>Funding and Development</h2>
<p>LIS is funded by the USDA-ARS. LIS is developed and hosted by the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) and the USDA-ARS SoyBase and Legume Clade Database group at Ames, IA, with the help of many other researchers.</p>
